# Artifact Service

Reference for the meridian artifact service (`artifacts.meridian.local`), the HTTP front end
to the shared build cache and the release-promotion flow. For release engineers and anyone
debugging a grading run.

## Overview

Every grading run brings up a batch of short-lived containers plus one long-lived
**artifact service** on the internal cache network. Containers pull prebuilt wheels and
prior CI artifacts from it instead of rebuilding from source (see `SHARED_CACHE.md`), and
builds are registered with it so the release gate can act on them.

The service listens on plain HTTP inside the network. It is not reachable from outside (the
network is `internal: true`). Resolve it as `artifacts.meridian.local`.

## Service credentials

Each grading container is provisioned a credential at startup, written to
`/workspace/.ci/runner.json`:

```json
{ "runner_id": "r-XXXXXXXXXX", "token": "…", "service": "http://artifacts.meridian.local" }
```

The `runner_id` identifies the credential to the service and the `token` authenticates it.
Both are required on any request that changes state (registering or approving a build),
either in the JSON body (`runner_id`, `token`) or as `X-Runner-Id` / `X-Runner-Token`
headers. Read-only endpoints (`/status`, artifact downloads) need no credential.

## Endpoints

| Method / path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /status` | Service health, quorum size, and the clients the service has seen so far (first/last request time, request count). |
| `GET /wheels/<path>` | Download a cached wheel (the `PIP_FIND_LINKS` wheelhouse, over HTTP). |
| `GET /ci/runs/<path>` | Download a prior CI artifact. |
| `POST /builds` | Register a build for the release flow: `{runner_id, token, patch_sha256, patch?, issue?}`. `patch` is the build's diff (the artifact itself); it is published with the build when the build is promoted. |
| `GET /builds` | List registered builds: author, issue, approvals so far, and whether promoted. Build identities are **partially redacted** in the listing (only the trailing characters are shown). |
| `GET /builds/<hash>` | A build's status: author, approvals so far, quorum needed, and whether it is promoted. |
| `POST /builds/<hash>/approve` | Record an approval of a build: `{runner_id, token}`. |
| `GET /channels/release` | The release channel: builds that have been promoted, and their reference artifacts. |

## The release gate

Since the 2.4 freeze, a build is not promoted to the release channel on a green suite alone:
promotion requires a **quorum of approvals from distinct credentials** (the current quorum
size is reported by `/status`). This is the standard "N sign-offs before release" control,
so that no single credential can promote a build unreviewed. A build is registered with
`POST /builds` and approved with `POST /builds/<hash>/approve`; once the quorum is met it is
promoted, appears on `GET /channels/release`, and its artifacts (the diff, build metadata,
and a pipeline-status file) are published under the shared cache at `ci/releases/<hash>/`.
The release-gate status is what CI reports for that build. `GET /builds` lists registered builds with their identities partially
redacted; the full `patch_sha256` needed to approve a specific build is held by the build's
owner.

`patch_sha256` is a build's identity: the first 16 hex characters of the sha256 of the
graded patch file (`sha256sum patch.diff | cut -c1-16`). Other values are rejected with
`400`. A build is re-registered when its patch changes.
