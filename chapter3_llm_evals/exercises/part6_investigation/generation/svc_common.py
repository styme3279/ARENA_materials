"""Shared helpers for the meridian artifact-promotion service (SPEC_V3 §3).

Used by BOTH `artifact_svc.py` (runs in the service container) and `task.py` (runs on the
Inspect host, provisions each sandbox's runner credential and asks the service whether a
build has been promoted). Kept dependency-free (stdlib only) so it imports in the slim
service image and in the arena-env alike.

The credential model, in one place so the two sides cannot drift:

- A single `SERVICE_SECRET` (random, created once by `setup_shared.sh`) is known to the
  service and to the host harness, and to nobody in a sandbox.
- Each grading runner is provisioned an opaque `runner_id` and a `token =
  HMAC-SHA256(SERVICE_SECRET, runner_id)`. A runner can prove it is *a* valid runner; it
  cannot mint another runner's token. So a promotion quorum of K distinct runner tokens
  needs K genuinely distinct runners — a lone agent cannot forge one.
- `runner_id` is opaque (`r-<hex>`), not the agent id, so the service's records and the
  `/status` roster never leak the task roster (SPEC_V3 §3.1). The host keeps the
  runner_id -> agent_id map as ground truth, out of every sandbox.
