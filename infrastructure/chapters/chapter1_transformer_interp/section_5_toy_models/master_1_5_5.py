Almost all of the interpretability you've done so far in this chapter has been **activation-based**: you trained SAEs and transcoders to decompose what a model is *representing* at a given layer, and you used those latents as the nodes of circuit analysis. But there's something conspicuously missing from that picture. A neural network is not its activations — it's a function, and that function is implemented by its **parameters**. Activations are just what the parameters do to a particular input. If we want to know *how the model computes*, rather than *what it represents while computing*, then at some point we have to read the weights.

This exercise set covers **linear parameter decomposition**, a family of methods developed in 2025-26 (APD → SPD → VPD, the last two by Goodfire) which decompose a network's *weights* into a sum of simple, individually-ablatable pieces called **parameter components**. The headline claims are striking:

* The same method decomposes MLPs *and* attention layers (no separate treatment needed, unlike SAEs/transcoders), and finds attention computations that are genuinely **spread across multiple heads** — something head-level analysis can't even express.
* The decomposition is **strongly resistant to feature splitting** — by an argument you'll be able to make precise by the end of section 1, and which Goodfire verified empirically with capacity sweeps (4× the subcomponent budget, same number of alive subcomponents).
* Because components live in parameter space, you can **edit the model's algorithm by hand**: in section 3 you'll perform a rank-1 surgical edit that makes a language model believe every emoticon is a surprised face `:o`, while barely touching its behaviour anywhere else.

The exercises are based on the paper [Interpreting Language Model Parameters](https://www.goodfire.ai/research/interpreting-lm-parameters) (Bushnaq, Braun, Clive-Griffin et al., May 2026), which introduced adVersarial Parameter Decomposition (VPD) and applied it to a 67M-parameter language model, plus its predecessor [Stochastic Parameter Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20790) (SPD). You'll implement the method from scratch on a toy model of superposition (the one from section 1.5.4 — helpful background but **not** a prerequisite, everything we use is recapped from scratch), then load Goodfire's actual decomposition of their 4-layer Pile model and use it to dissect attention behaviours and perform the emoticon edit.

## Content & Learning Objectives

### 1️⃣ The Maths of Parameter Decomposition

What does it even mean to split a weight matrix into "parts"? This section builds the conceptual and mathematical core of the method: rank-1 subcomponents, causal importance, ablation masks, and the four properties (faithfulness, minimality, mechanistic faithfulness, simplicity) that the loss terms optimise for. Mostly maths and small tensor exercises — by the end you'll have implemented every loss function used to train a real decomposition.

> ##### Learning Objectives
>
> - Understand why activation-based decompositions (SAEs, transcoders) can be mechanistically unfaithful, and what parameter decomposition does differently
> - Decompose weight matrices into rank-1 subcomponents, and understand why we allow *more* subcomponents than the matrix's rank
> - Understand causal importance values and ablation masks, and implement the sampling scheme for stochastic ablations
> - Implement the loss terms of the VPD objective (all but the adversarial one, which you'll build in section 2), and explain which of the four desiderata each one optimises for
> - Explain why requiring robustness to ablations *in any combination* rules out memorisation ("lookup table") decompositions and feature splitting

### 2️⃣ SPD & VPD in Toy Models of Superposition

You'll implement the full decomposition pipeline from scratch and run it on the toy model of superposition (recapped in section 1; trained from scratch here): a model squeezing 5 sparse features through 2 hidden dimensions. The decomposition should discover — without being told — that this model consists of 5 separate mechanisms, one per feature. Then you'll break the method (training with naive masking) and fix it (adversarial masking), to understand *why* the ablation-robustness machinery exists.

> ##### Learning Objectives
>
> - Implement `ComponentLinear`: a drop-in replacement for `nn.Linear` that computes with masked subcomponents
> - Implement the causal importance function, leaky-hard sigmoids and their straight-through gradients
> - Train a full SPD decomposition of TMS and verify it recovers the ground-truth mechanisms
> - Implement PGD-based adversarial mask sampling, and use it to expose mechanistically unfaithful decompositions
> - Break the method's most load-bearing piece (mask sampling) and audit the wreckage with your own adversarial evaluator

### 3️⃣ Interpreting a Real LM's Parameters

Goodfire released their full decomposition of a 4-layer, 67M parameter language model trained on the Pile: 24 weight matrices split into ~10,000 alive rank-1 subcomponents. You'll load it, verify the headline reconstruction numbers, then use it for the paper's most novel analysis: decomposing attention behaviours (previous-token, syntax-boundary, and "there is/it is" detection) into interactions between subcomponents that span multiple heads. You'll finish by hand-editing one rank-1 subcomponent to rewrite the model's emoticon predictions.

> ##### Learning Objectives
>
> - Load a real parameter decomposition and compute causal importances on your own prompts
> - Implement Static and Data-Dependent Interaction Strength for QK circuits (including RoPE)
> - Reproduce the paper's finding that previous-token behaviour is distributed across attention heads
> - Perform an interpretable rank-1 model edit and measure its off-target effects

### ☆ Bonus

Attribution graphs through parameter subcomponents, the "princess lost her crown" case study, and suggested extensions.

## Why decompose parameters instead of activations?

Let's start with an uncomfortable fact about the methods you've used so far. An SAE or transcoder is a **replacement model**: to "explain" an MLP layer, we train a *different, wider* network (encoder, sparse nonlinearity, decoder) to imitate it, and then we interpret the latents of the imitation. This raises an awkward question that the interpretability community spent much of 2024-25 wrestling with: **when you interpret the replacement model, are you learning about the original model, or about the replacement?**

There are at least three concrete ways this bites:

1. **Functional form mismatch.** The replacement model belongs to a different function class than the thing it imitates: a transcoder with 16k latents and a JumpReLU can express computations that the original 768-wide GELU MLP *cannot*. Nothing in the training objective stops the transcoder from "explaining" the layer using machinery the layer doesn't have. (The dual problem also occurs: there can be structure the original model has that the SAE architecture cannot express, e.g. multidimensional or non-linearly-encoded features.)

2. **Feature splitting.** Make your SAE dictionary bigger and your latents split into ever-narrower variants: a "math" latent becomes "math in LaTeX", "math in plain text", "arithmetic", ... There's no natural place to stop — in the limit, the dictionary can dedicate one latent per *datapoint* and achieve excellent sparsity and reconstruction while telling you nothing about the model's mechanisms. The number of latents you find is a property of your dictionary size, not of the model.

3. **Attention is left out.** Transcoders replace MLPs. Attention layers — the part of a transformer that makes it a transformer — have resisted satisfying activation-based decomposition, and circuit analyses like Anthropic's attribution graphs typically treat the QK circuit as given rather than decomposed. Worse, attention computations need not respect head boundaries: a single "behaviour" can be smeared across several heads (and one head can host several behaviours), so *heads* are the wrong unit of analysis too.

Parameter decomposition starts from a different premise. The model's parameters $\theta$ are a single vector in parameter space, and whatever "mechanisms" the model has, they are *made of parameters*. So instead of asking "what directions in activation space are meaningful?", we ask:

<blockquote>

**Can we write $\theta$ as a sum of vectors in *parameter space*, $\theta = \sum_c \theta_c$, such that each $\theta_c$ implements one simple piece of the model's algorithm, and only a few pieces are needed on any given input?**

</blockquote>

Notice the constraint this buys us immediately: every candidate decomposition *is* a set of weights for the original architecture. We never leave the model's function class. There is no replacement model to be unfaithful to the original — the components, summed, literally *are* the original. The question is just whether we can find a sum whose individual terms are interpretable.

<details>
<summary>Aside - what happened to "features"?</summary>

The unit of analysis has changed. SAE latents are *representational* objects: "the model is currently thinking about the Golden Gate Bridge". Parameter components are *computational* objects: "this piece of weights reads direction $v$ and writes direction $u$, implementing one step of an algorithm". A parameter component is closer to what circuit-style interpretability always wanted as its nodes: a thing that *does* something, not a thing that *means* something. The two views are complementary — a component's read/write directions live in activation space, so you can still ask what inputs activate it.

## Mechanisms and ablatability

Before any maths: what should "the model's mechanisms" even mean? The papers take a deliberately minimal stance. They don't presuppose mechanisms are neurons, heads, layers, or directions. They assume only one thing: **a typical network doesn't use all of its machinery on every input.** On the prompt `"2+2="`, whatever machinery handles French grammar is idle. If that weren't true — if every part of the network did something essential on every input — the network wouldn't be modular at all, and *no* decomposition method could carve it into parts.

"Idle" has a precise, testable meaning for parameters: **if a piece of the parameters isn't used on an input, we should be able to delete it — set it to zero — on that input without changing the model's output.** And not just delete it fully: any partial scaling of an unused piece should also be harmless, and deleting unused pieces *in any combination* should be harmless too.

This is the entire conceptual core of the method, so let's give it a name: a piece of parameters is **causally important** on an input if ablating it (fully or partially) changes the output, and the goal of parameter decomposition is:

> Find pieces of the parameters such that **as few pieces as possible are causally important on each input**, while **every way of ablating the unimportant pieces leaves the output intact**.

Everything else in this section — the rank-1 parameterisation, the causal importance function, the five loss terms — is engineering to make this optimisable.

## Warm-up: why SVD isn't enough

Here's the most obvious way to split a weight matrix into rank-1 pieces: singular value decomposition. $W = \sum_i \sigma_i \vec{u}_i \vec{v}_i^\top$ gives us $\text{rank}(W)$ rank-1 matrices that sum exactly to $W$. Each piece "reads" the input direction $\vec{v}_i$ and "writes" the output direction $\sigma_i \vec{u}_i$. Faithful by construction. Are we done?

<details>
<summary>Refresher - SVD in one breath (and the torch gotcha)</summary>

Any matrix $W \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ factors as $W = U \Sigma V^\top = \sum_{i=1}^{\text{rank}(W)} \sigma_i \vec{u}_i \vec{v}_i^\top$, where the $\vec{u}_i$ (columns of $U$) are orthonormal directions in output space, the $\vec{v}_i$ (columns of $V$) are orthonormal directions in input space, and the singular values $\sigma_i \geq 0$ come sorted largest-first. Geometrically, term $i$ does: *project the input onto $\vec{v}_i$ (getting a scalar), multiply by $\sigma_i$, write that much of $\vec{u}_i$ to the output*. It's the optimal variance-capturing decomposition — keeping the top-$k$ terms gives the best rank-$k$ approximation of $W$.

In code: `U, S, Vt = t.linalg.svd(W, full_matrices=False)`. The classic gotcha: **torch returns $V^\top$, not $V$** — so $\vec{u}_i$ = `U[:, i]` (a column) but $\vec{v}_i$ = `Vt[i, :]` (a row). Sanity check worth typing: `t.dist(U @ t.diag(S) @ Vt, W)` should be ~0.

Let's test SVD against the ablatability criterion, on a setting where we know the ground truth: the **Toy Model of Superposition** — "**TMS**" from here on. This is the tiny model from Anthropic's [Toy Models of Superposition](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/toy_model/index.html) paper; the optional superposition & SAEs day (1.5.4) trains exactly this model. Here's the full setup in one block; nothing beyond it is assumed:

> **The TMS model** (Toy Model of Superposition). Input $x \in \mathbb{R}^5$; output $\hat{x} = \text{ReLU}(W^\top W x + b)$ with $W \in \mathbb{R}^{2 \times 5}$, $b \in \mathbb{R}^5$. "**Feature $j$**" just means **input coordinate $x_j$** — the training data has each coordinate independently nonzero with probability 0.05 (magnitude uniform in $[0,1]$), and the model's entire job is to squeeze those 5 sparse coordinates through a 2-dimensional bottleneck ($Wx$) and reconstruct them ($W^\top \cdot$, then ReLU + bias to clean up). A feature is "active" on an input when its coordinate is nonzero; the simplest probes of model behaviour are the one-hot inputs $e_j$ (exactly feature $j$ active, magnitude 1).

**What $W$ means.** Read $W$ column by column: column $j$ (a 2-vector) is feature $j$'s **address in the hidden space** — the direction the model uses to store that feature. The whole model is then a storage-and-retrieval scheme:

* **Store**: $Wx = \sum_j x_j\, W_{[:,j]}$ — the 2D hidden state is just "each active feature's address, scaled by its magnitude, all added together". Five addresses can't be orthogonal in 2 dimensions, so they unavoidably overlap: that overlap *is* superposition.
* **Retrieve**: row $j$ of $W^\top$ dots the hidden state with feature $j$'s own address — "how much of *my* direction is in there?". So entry $(j, k)$ of $W^\top W$ is just the dot product of two addresses: the diagonal is each feature recovering itself ($\approx \|W_{[:,j]}\|^2$), and the off-diagonals are **interference** from neighbours. For a pentagon the angles are 72° and 144°, so each active feature leaks $\approx \cos 72° \approx +0.31$ of itself into its neighbours' read-outs and $\approx \cos 144° \approx -0.81$ into the far pair.
* **Clean up**: the ReLU with a learned *negative* bias subtracts a small constant from every read-out and clips at zero — which deletes the typical (small, positive) interference while leaving genuinely-active features standing. This is the trick that makes superposition viable *on sparse data*: interference is usually from zero-or-one neighbours, rarely from several at once.

A converged $W$ has its 5 columns arranged as a pentagon in the 2D hidden space — equal spacing is just the arrangement that minimises the worst-case overlap between addresses. And now "the ground-truth mechanisms" should feel obvious rather than asserted: mechanism $j$ = "store feature $j$ at its address, and read it back out" = the rank-1 matrix built from column $j$. Five mechanisms — but **the matrix only has rank 2**, because all five live in the same 2D space.

Things to notice, tying back to the "what $W$ means" story:

* **The heatmap is the address-overlap table.** Diagonal ≈ 1.28 (each address recovering itself, $\|W_{[:,j]}\|^2$); each row also picks up ≈ **+0.40** from its two pentagon neighbours (72°) and ≈ **−1.04** from the far pair (144°) — the cosines from above, scaled by the address norms.
* **Run 1** (one feature at full magnitude): its own coordinate comes back ≈ 1.04 ✓. The far pair's interference is negative, so ReLU deletes it to exactly 0 — but the *neighbours* show small residues (≈ 0.18, 0.13): at magnitude 1.0 the +0.40 leak is more than the bias can fully subtract. Superposition is lossy, and the model accepts that loss because...
* **Run 2** (two features at training-typical magnitudes): ...on realistic sparse inputs the cleanup works — the reconstruction comes out essentially clean, all interference clipped away.
* **Run 3** (all five at once): output **all zeros**. Every read-out collects two −1.04 leaks, which swamp its own signal, and ReLU kills everything. Superposition is a bet on sparsity; this input never occurs in training, so the model never pays this price. Keep this one in mind for the whole chapter: *which* parameters matter depends on *which* features are active — exactly the intuition that "causal importance" will formalise.

Now, the question this warm-up actually cares about: can SVD's two rank-1 terms carve those **five** store-and-retrieve mechanisms apart? This immediately tells us two things:

* **SVD can only ever give us 2 pieces** for this matrix — it cannot possibly produce a piece per mechanism. Any decomposition restricted to ≤ rank pieces is structurally unable to resolve mechanisms that live in superposition. This is why parameter decomposition allows **more subcomponents than the rank of the matrix** — exactly mirroring how SAEs use overcomplete dictionaries because there are more features than dimensions.
* Each SVD direction is a mixture of all 5 features, so on an input where only feature 3 is active, **both** SVD components are needed — neither is ablatable. The minimality score (number of causally important pieces per input) of the SVD decomposition is as bad as possible.

A helpful slogan (paraphrasing a footnote of the paper): parameter decomposition is like SVD, except we allow more subcomponents than the rank, and we choose the subcomponents to be the parts of the matrix with similar downstream causal effects — thereby taking the nonlinearities into account.

### Exercise - compute per-input ablatability of SVD components

> ```yaml
> Difficulty: 🔴🔴⚪⚪⚪
> Importance: 🔵🔵🔵⚪⚪
> 
> You should spend up to 10-15 minutes on this exercise.
> ```

We've given you a converged TMS weight matrix `W` (2×5, pentagon structure) and its bias `b` via `utils.load_pretrained_tms_5_2()` in the test cell below. Implement `svd_ablation_curve`, which asks, for every (SVD term, feature) combination: *"if I delete this term from the weights, how badly does the model's output change on an input where only that feature is active?"* Concretely:

1. Compute the SVD of `W` and form the rank-1 terms $\sigma_i \vec{u}_i \vec{v}_i^\top$ (two of them, since $\text{rank}(W) = 2$; mind the `Vt` gotcha from the refresher).
2. For each one-hot input $x = e_j$ and each SVD term $i$: build the ablated weights $W' = W - \sigma_i \vec{u}_i \vec{v}_i^\top$, and run the model **twice** — reuse `tms_forward` from the demo cell: `tms_forward(x, W, b)` vs `tms_forward(x, W_ablated, b)`. Passing $W'$ as the weight argument substitutes it in **both** places $W$ appears.
3. The measurement is the **relative output change**: $\|\text{out} - \text{out}'\|_2 \,/\, \|\text{out}\|_2$ — and "out" means the **whole 5-dimensional output vector**, not just coordinate $j$: deleting a term can corrupt *other* features' read-outs, and that damage counts. Dividing by the original output's norm makes the scale self-interpreting: **0 = unchanged, ≈1 = the output moved by about its own entire size**.

How to read the result: entry $(i, j)$ near 0 would mean "term $i$ is ablatable when only feature $j$ is active" — the ablatability criterion for "term $i$ isn't part of feature $j$'s mechanism". Values ≳ 0.3 mean the output moved by 30%+ of its own size — badly corrupted. A genuinely unused piece would score ≈ 0 (you'll see values like that in section 2, when the decomposition actually matches the mechanisms).

<details>
<summary>Help - my values look wrong / the test fails</summary>

The four classic versions of this bug, in descending frequency:

* **Comparing only output coordinate $j$** (`output[j]`) instead of the whole output vector. The measurement is `(out - out_ablated).norm() / out.norm()` over all 5 coordinates.
* **Forgetting the normalisation** — returning the raw $\|\text{out} - \text{out}'\|_2$ without dividing by $\|\text{out}\|_2$.
* **Returning the sum of squared differences** (`((a - b)**2).sum()`) — that's $\|\cdot\|_2^2$, not the norm; take its square root, or just use `.norm()`.
* **Ablating only one occurrence of $W$** — the model uses $W$ twice ($W^\top W$); both must be the ablated $W'$.

Also fine to know: ablating via SVD reconstruction (`S[i] = 0`, then `U @ diag(S) @ Vt`) is exactly equivalent to subtracting $\sigma_i \vec{u}_i \vec{v}_i^\top$ — either way works.

</details>

If SVD components were ablatable mechanisms, this matrix would have a small entry for most (term, input) pairs: each input would tolerate ablation of the terms it doesn't use. You should find the opposite — **for every input $j$, at least one (and typically both) of the two SVD terms is unablatable**. (Print the per-input max over terms alongside the heatmap.)

One more wrinkle worth savouring: for a perfect pentagon with equal column norms $r$, $WW^\top = \tfrac{5r^2}{2} I$ — the two singular values are *equal*, so the SVD directions themselves are arbitrary (any rotation of the pair is an equally valid SVD, and `torch.linalg.svd` just picks one). Individual heatmap cells can therefore legitimately come out small for some inputs, depending on which basis you were handed. The decomposition isn't just causally wrong, it isn't even *well-defined* — yet another way variance-based decomposition fails to see mechanisms.

<summary>What you should see, and why it matters</summary>

Every (term, input) pair shows a large output change: neither SVD term can be ablated on any input. Per the ablatability criterion, the SVD decomposition claims the model uses **all** its machinery on **every** input — i.e., it has completely failed to find the modular structure we know is there (5 nearly-independent feature mechanisms).

The deep reason: SVD terms are chosen for *geometric* orthogonality, not *causal* separability. Mechanisms in superposition are not orthogonal — the 5 pentagon directions overlap — so no orthogonal basis of rank-1 terms can isolate them. We need (a) more terms than the rank, and (b) an objective that scores terms by *what happens downstream when you ablate them*, not by capturing variance.

## The setup: subcomponents, and the four desiderata

<figure class="paperfig">

<figcaption>Decomposing a model's parameters into vectors in parameter space that are optimised to approximate its mechanisms. Figure from <a href="https://www.goodfire.ai/research/interpreting-lm-parameters">Bushnaq et al. (2026)</a>, loaded from the original Goodfire post.</figcaption>
</figure>

Now we can define the objects we will be optimizing.

We could decompose the parameters $\theta$ directly into a sum of matrix component. However, each component would cost as much memory as the whole model. Instead, we work matrix-by-matrix. For each weight matrix $W^l \in \mathbb{R}^{d_\text{out} \times d_\text{in}}$ that we choose to decompose, we learn $C$ rank-1 **subcomponents**:

$$W^l \approx \sum_{c=1}^{C} \vec{U}^l_c (\vec{V}^l_c)^\top, \qquad \vec{U}^l_c \in \mathbb{R}^{d_\text{out}}, \quad \vec{V}^l_c \in \mathbb{R}^{d_\text{in}}$$

Stacking these as matrices: $U^l_{\text{math}} \in \mathbb{R}^{d_\text{out} \times C}$ and $V^l \in \mathbb{R}^{d_\text{in} \times C}$, with $W^l \approx U^l_{\text{math}} (V^l)^\top$ — exactly the same shape of parameterisation as an SAE's decoder/encoder pair, but for *weights*, and crucially with $C$ allowed to be much larger than $\text{rank}(W^l)$.

<details>
<summary>Note on tensor conventions (CS vs math)</summary>

There are two natural conventions for laying out the matrices $U$ and $V$, and they differ by a transpose:

- **Math convention** — vectors are column vectors; a matrix acts on the *right*. So $W = U_{\text{math}} V^\top$ with $U_{\text{math}} \in \mathbb{R}^{d_\text{out} \times C}$ and $V \in \mathbb{R}^{d_\text{in} \times C}$.
- **CS / row-vector convention** (PyTorch's default) — data tensors are row vectors; operations flow left-to-right as `x @ W`. This is what the code uses.

In code (Goodfire's convention, used throughout), `V` keeps the same shape as in the maths, `(d_in, C)`, but `U` is stored *transposed*, shape `(C, d_out)`, so that the forward pass reads cleanly left-to-right: `x @ V` gives per-subcomponent "read" activations `(..., C)`, and `(x @ V) @ U` gives the layer output. The reconstructed weight in PyTorch's `(d_out, d_in)` layout is therefore `(V @ U).T`.

**TL;DR:** math-$U^l_{\text{math}}$ = code-`U.T`. 

Since we primarily reccomend using einops, this doesn't matter too much.

</details>

Each subcomponent has a clean reading: $\vec{V}^l_c$ is its **read direction** (it responds to the component of the layer input along $\vec{V}^l_c$) and $\vec{U}^l_c$ is its **write direction** (what it adds to the layer output, scaled by how strongly the read fired). A subcomponent is a minimal "wire" through the layer.

(A *component* — a full mechanism — may consist of several subcomponents across several matrices, grouped by clustering. The paper found subcomponents were usually interpretable on their own, so we'll mostly work at subcomponent level and mention clustering only in passing.)

The subcomponents are trained to satisfy four properties. Learn these four names now — every loss term in the next sections exists to serve exactly one of them:

1. **Parameter faithfulness.** The subcomponents (plus a designated residual term) must sum to the original weights. We're decomposing *the* model, not fitting a lookalike.
2. **Minimality.** On any particular input, as *few* subcomponents as possible should be causally important.
3. **Mechanistic faithfulness.** On any input, ablating the causally *unimportant* subcomponents — partially, fully, **in any combination** — must not change the model's output.
4. **Simplicity.** Each subcomponent should contain as little computational machinery as possible (being rank-1 is part of this; we'll see it's not quite enough).

<details>
<summary>Question - "why not just say minimality?" What work is mechanistic faithfulness doing that minimality isn't?</summary>

Minimality only counts how many subcomponents are *labelled* important. Without mechanistic faithfulness, the labels are unverified claims! Mechanistic faithfulness is the enforcement mechanism: it says the unimportant-labelled subcomponents must *actually* be harmless to ablate, under every combination of partial ablations. Minimality pushes the count of important labels down; mechanistic faithfulness pushes back, forcing a label of "unimportant" to be earned. The tension between these two is the entire training dynamic — exactly analogous to sparsity-vs-reconstruction in SAE training, but with "reconstruction" replaced by something much stricter.

## Parameter faithfulness and the $\Delta$-component

In practice $\sum_c \vec{U}^l_c (\vec{V}^l_c)^\top$ won't hit $W^l$ exactly. VPD handles the difference explicitly, defining a **$\Delta$-component** per matrix:

$$\Delta^l := W^l - \sum_c \vec{U}^l_c (\vec{V}^l_c)^\top$$

The full decomposition is then *exactly* faithful by construction: subcomponents + $\Delta^l$ = $W^l$. But this would be a cheat if $\Delta^l$ were allowed to be large (the "decomposition" could hide the whole model inside $\Delta$!), so $\Delta^l$ is (a) penalised towards zero with an MSE loss, and (b) **defined to have causal importance 0 everywhere** — it must always be fully ablatable, in combination with anything else. The model's actual machinery can't hide in a term that has to survive being deleted on every input.

### Exercise - implement `weight_delta` and `faithfulness_loss`

> ```yaml
> Difficulty: 🔴⚪⚪⚪⚪
> Importance: 🔵🔵⚪⚪⚪
> 
> You should spend up to 5 minutes on this exercise.
> ```

A two-liner each, to fix the definitions precisely.

`weight_delta` computes $\Delta^l = W^l - \sum_c \vec{U}^l_c (\vec{V}^l_c)^\top$, shape `(d_out, d_in)`. The one trap is the tensor convention from the previous section: code-`U` is stored transposed, shape `(C, d_out)`, so the reconstructed weight in PyTorch's `(d_out, d_in)` layout is `(V @ U).T` — if your test failure looks like a transposed answer, this is why.

`faithfulness_loss` is the mean squared entry of $\Delta$ pooled across **all** decomposed matrices:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{faithfulness}} = \frac{\sum_l \sum_{i,j} (\Delta^l_{ij})^2}{\sum_l d^l_{\text{out}}\, d^l_{\text{in}}}$$

— one global mean (total sum of squares over total element count), *not* a mean of per-matrix means; the two differ when the matrices have different sizes. The result is a single non-negative scalar: 0 exactly when the subcomponents sum to the weights, falling towards 0 over training as parameter faithfulness is achieved. No printed output here — the test cell passing is the signal.

For a layer input $\vec{x}$, the quantity `x @ V` will matter a lot, so it gets a name. Following the paper, the **subcomponent activation** $a^l_c$ is

$$a^l_c = \|\vec{U}^l_c\| \, (\vec{V}^l_c)^\top \vec{x}$$

i.e. the raw read-out $(\vec{V}^l_c)^\top \vec{x}$ (which we'll call the **inner activation**, what `x @ V` computes), scaled by the norm of the write vector. The $\|\vec{U}\|$ factor is there because the $U, V$ pair is only defined up to a scalar ($\vec{U} \to \beta \vec{U}, \vec{V} \to \vec{V}/\beta$ leaves the subcomponent unchanged), so inner activations of *different* subcomponents aren't comparable until you fix the gauge. When we say a subcomponent "fires" on a token, we mean $a^l_c$ is large; this exact definition matters again when we do attributions in the section 3 bonus.

## Causal importance and ablation masks

Now the heart of the method. For each subcomponent $c$, each input, and (for sequence models) each token position, we want a number

$$g^l_c \in [0, 1]$$

— the **causal importance** — meaning:

* $g^l_c = 0$: this subcomponent is unused here; you may ablate it, partially or fully, in combination with anything else, with no effect on the output.
* $g^l_c = 1$: untouchable; any ablation of it changes the output.
* in between: partial ablatability — you may shrink it to no less than $g$ times its original size, i.e. scaling it by any factor in $[g, 1]$ is harmless.

Where do these numbers come from? They're the output of a learned **causal importance function** — a small neural network (one tiny MLP per subcomponent for toy models; a shared transformer for LMs) that looks at the inner activations and *predicts* ablatability. It's trained jointly with the subcomponents.

This is pretty unusual: rather than computing importance via some fixed attribution formula (gradients, integrated gradients...), we train a network whose predictions are *verified by actually doing the ablations*. The CI function can't lie:

* If it claims $g = 0$ for a subcomponent that matters, the ablated forward passes will reconstruct the output badly → reconstruction loss punishes it.
* If it claims $g = 1$ for everything, reconstruction is perfect but the minimality loss (below) punishes it.

To "actually do the ablations", we define **ablation masks**. Given causal importances $g$, sample masks

$$m^l_c \in [g^l_c,\ 1]$$

and run a forward pass with each subcomponent scaled by its mask:

$$W'^l = \Delta^l \cdot m^l_\Delta + \sum_c m^l_c\, \vec{U}^l_c (\vec{V}^l_c)^\top$$

(the $\Delta$-component gets a mask too, sampled from $[0,1]$ since its causal importance is 0 by definition). If the causal importances are honest, then *any* choice of masks in these ranges gives $f(x | W'^1, \dots, W'^L) \approx f(x | W^1, \dots, W^L)$.

Ths, given this: masks (like $g$) are now per-input, and for sequence models, per *token position*. The masked model runs with a **different effective weight matrix at every position of every prompt**. "Which weights is the model using right now?" becomes a question with a token-by-token answer; section 3's attention analysis lives entirely off this. The reconstruction loss is the KL divergence (for LMs; MSE for toy models) between the original and masked outputs.

<img src="https://cute.sus.cat/dev/img/ci-masks.svg" alt="Causal importance values and interval masks" width="860">
<figcaption>What a causal importance value claims, and how the claim gets verified: masks sampled from $[g, 1]$ must leave the output unchanged.</figcaption>
</figure>

Ideally we'd verify *all* mask combinations — that's intractable, so we sample. How we sample is exactly the difference between the two methods you'll implement:

* **SPD** samples masks *uniformly at random*: $m = g + (1-g) \cdot u$, $u \sim U(0,1)$. ("**S**tochastic")
* **VPD** *additionally* optimises masks by gradient ascent to **maximise** reconstruction error — adversarial sampling. ("ad**V**ersarial") If your decomposition survives an adversary picking the worst legal mask combination, you can trust the g-labels a lot more.

### Exercise - implement `sample_stochastic_masks`

> ```yaml
> Difficulty: 🔴⚪⚪⚪⚪
> Importance: 🔵🔵🔵⚪⚪
> 
> You should spend up to 5 minutes on this exercise.
> ```

Implement stochastic mask sampling: given a causal importance tensor `ci` of shape `(batch, C)` (or `(batch, seq, C)` — write it shape-agnostically over leading dims), return a tuple `(mask, delta_mask)`:

$$m^l_c = g^l_c + (1 - g^l_c)\, u, \quad u \sim U(0,1) \quad\Longrightarrow\quad m^l_c \sim U(g^l_c,\, 1)$$

$$m^l_\Delta \sim U(0, 1) \qquad \text{(}\Delta\text{-component always gets the full interval, since its CI is 0 by definition)}$$

`mask` has the same shape as `ci` and `delta_mask` has shape `ci.shape[:-1]`. Endpoint check: $g = 1 \Rightarrow m = 1$ (untouchable); $g = 0 \Rightarrow m \sim U(0,1)$ (anything goes).

One practical instruction that will save you a debugging session in section 2: **create the new tensors on `ci`'s device** (`t.rand_like(ci)` inherits it automatically; a bare `t.rand(shape)` lands on CPU). The test runs on CPU so it can't catch this — but the training loop runs on GPU, and a CPU-born delta mask will crash it there.

<summary>Question - why are masks continuous (partial ablations), rather than just testing m ∈ {g, 1} (drop it or keep it)?</summary>

Several reasons:

1. **It's a stronger requirement that better matches "unused".** If a subcomponent truly has no causal role on this input (e.g. its read direction is orthogonal to the incoming activations, or its output is killed by a downstream ReLU), then *any* scaling of it is harmless — not just full deletion. Demanding robustness on the whole interval $[g, 1]$ tests for genuine non-participation rather than a lucky cancellation at one point.

2. **Optimisation.** Continuous masks make the reconstruction loss a smooth function of $g$, giving useful gradients to train the CI function. Binary ablations would need REINFORCE-style tricks or straight-through estimators.

3. **It rules out cancellation pathologies.** Two subcomponents that cancel each other ($\theta_A = -\theta_B$ in effect) could be jointly deleted at exactly $m_A = m_B = 0$, but intermediate independent scalings break the cancellation. Under interval-valued masks they'd be caught and labelled causally important — which is correct: machinery that must be removed *in lockstep* is machinery, not noise.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Question - in mask = g + (1-g)·u, what happens at g=1 and g=0? Why is the lower end of the interval g rather than 0 always?</summary>

At $g = 1$ the interval collapses: the mask is always 1, the subcomponent always fully present — "you may not touch this". At $g = 0$ the mask is uniform on $[0,1]$: anything goes. The lower limit is $g$ because causal importance is precisely the claim "this fraction of the subcomponent must stay". Allowing masks below $g$ would test ablations the CI function never claimed were safe; the point is only to verify claims that *were* made (the method punishes overly-conservative claims through minimality, not through reconstruction).

## Minimality: the importance penalty

If the CI function were only trained on reconstruction, it would output $g = 1$ everywhere ("nothing may be ablated") and be trivially correct. The **importance minimality loss** provides the counterpressure:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{importance-minimality}} = \frac{1}{BT} \sum_{b,t} \sum_{l} \sum_{c} |g^l_{b,t,c}|^p, \qquad p > 0$$

This is the familiar $L_p$ sparsity penalty — it's playing exactly the same role as the L1 penalty on SAE activations, but on *claimed causal importances* rather than on latent activations. In practice $p < 1$ works much better (the LM run anneals $p$ from 2 down to 0.4 over training); recall from the SAE literature why: with $p = 1$, the gradient pressure on a latent is constant regardless of size, so genuinely-useful medium-sized values get crushed ("shrinkage"); with $p < 1$ the penalty's gradient *decreases* for larger values, so it mostly attacks values that are already small, pushing them to exactly 0 while leaving committed values alone.

Since $B$ is batch size and $T$ sequence length (for LMs; drop $T$ for toy models), the sum-over-$b,t$ divided by $BT$ is just a mean over inputs: the loss is "the total $p$-powered importance claimed per input, summed over layers and subcomponents". For $p \to 0$, $|g|^p \to \mathbb{1}[g \neq 0]$, so you can read it as a soft count of how many subcomponents are claimed important — smaller is sparser.

<details>
<summary>Refresher - L_p penalties and why p &lt; 1 makes things exactly zero</summary>

The penalty treats each value independently; its gradient with respect to one value $g > 0$ is $p\,g^{p-1}$. The exponent decides who feels the pressure:

* $p = 2$: gradient $2g$ — *vanishes* as $g \to 0$. Small values feel almost nothing, so nothing is ever pushed to exactly zero (this is why weight decay doesn't sparsify).
* $p = 1$: gradient constant at $1$ — everything shrinks at the same rate, including large values the model genuinely needs. Values do hit zero, but committed ones get dragged down too ("shrinkage").
* $p < 1$: gradient *grows* as $g \to 0$ (and blows up at $g = 0$ — hence the `eps` in the exercise below). Small values get crushed to exactly zero; large values feel almost nothing. That's the profile you want for "kill the stragglers, leave the committed alone".

The same logic underlies sparsity penalties in SAE training, covered in the optional superposition & SAEs day (1.5.4) — the facts above are all this section uses.

### Exercise - implement `importance_minimality_loss`

> ```yaml
> Difficulty: 🔴🔴⚪⚪⚪
> Importance: 🔵🔵🔵⚪⚪
> 
> You should spend up to 10 minutes on this exercise.
> ```

Implement the importance penalty in the fused form Goodfire's code actually uses, which folds in the frequency penalty (you'll meet the *reason* for the frequency term in the next subsection — implement now, understand in a moment):

$$\sum_l \sum_c \Big[ \text{mean}_{b(,t)}\big[(g+\varepsilon)^p\big]_c \;+\; \beta \cdot \text{mean}_{b(,t)}\big[(g+\varepsilon)^p\big]_c \cdot \log_2\big(1 + \textstyle\sum_{b(,t)}(g+\varepsilon)^p\big)_c \Big]$$

i.e. per subcomponent: its mean $p$-powered importance, plus $\beta$ times that mean up-weighted by the log of its *batch-summed* importance. Note every operation here is **per subcomponent**: the means and sums run over the batch/position dims only, giving vectors $\text{mean}_c$ and $\text{sum}_c$ of shape `(C_l,)` per layer, and only then do you sum over subcomponents and layers, returning a single scalar for the whole dict. With $\beta = 0$ this reduces to the plain $L_p$ penalty $\frac{1}{BT}\sum |g|^p$ from the paper. Take `ci_per_layer` as a dict of tensors of shape `(batch, ..., C_l)` — the number of subcomponents $C_l$ may differ between layers — and mean/sum over all leading dims. The `eps` is added before exponentiation for numerical stability of the backward pass when `p < 1` (the gradient of $x^p$ blows up at $x=0$, per the refresher above). No printed output — the test cell passing is the signal.

## Simplicity: rank-1 isn't enough, and the frequency penalty

Why do we need a simplicity property at all? Because without one, there's a degenerate solution: *one* component containing the entire model, causally important on every input. Perfectly faithful, perfectly mechanistically faithful, and minimal in the worst way (only 1 component is ever important!). Constraining subcomponents to rank 1 blocks this — a rank-1 matrix can't contain the whole model.

But rank-1 has a subtler failure mode. Two genuinely-distinct mechanisms, used on disjoint sets of inputs, can *sum to a rank-1 matrix* (e.g. if they share a read or write direction). Then one subcomponent can host both mechanisms: it fires on the union of their inputs, polysemantically. The importance-minimality loss has no opinion — either way, one subcomponent is important per input. To break the tie, VPD adds a slightly-superlinear penalty on **activation frequency**:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{frequency-minimality}} = \frac{1}{BT}\sum_{b,t,l,c} |g^l_{b,t,c}|^p \cdot \log_2 \Big(1 + \sum_{b',t'} |g^l_{b',t',c}|^p \Big)$$

Read it as: each importance value is up-weighted by (the log of) *how often that subcomponent is important across the whole batch*. A subcomponent important on 20% of tokens pays more per firing than one important on 1% of tokens. Splitting a doubled-up subcomponent into its two parts now strictly reduces the loss — each part fires less often than the union did.

<details>
<summary>Wait - doesn't penalising frequency cause feature splitting, like in SAEs?!</summary>
 
There is pressure, but the *mechanistic faithfulness* constraint caps it.

You can only split a subcomponent into narrower ones if the resulting pieces are each individually ablatable on inputs where they're claimed unimportant (under any combination of ablations, including adversarial ones).

If you split a real mechanism into two context-specific halves, then on a "half A" input the "half B" piece is claimed-unimportant, and the adversary will scale it to some awkward intermediate value and break the computation — because in the target model those weights *are* used (they're the same mechanism!). The split only survives if the model's weights really do contain two separable mechanisms.

SAEs have no analogous check: a split latent just needs to reconstruct activations on its narrow slice, and nothing audits its behaviour on inputs outside that slice.

You'll see this play out twice: in section 2 your TMS decomposition gets 4× more capacity than it needs and should leave the surplus dead, and in section 3 you'll count alive subcomponents in the LM decomposition (the paper's capacity sweep found the alive count flat at ~6,500-7,000 from 0.5× to 4× capacity, while transcoders scaled linearly with dictionary size).

</figure>

This was already implemented as the $\beta$ term of your `importance_minimality_loss` (Goodfire's code fuses the two penalties into `mean_c + β · mean_c · log2(1 + sum_c)`; comparing that line against the display equation above is a worthwhile 60 seconds). For TMS in section 2 we'll run with $\beta = 0$, matching the original SPD experiment — the frequency term earns its keep at LM scale. The thing to retain is *why* it exists: **rank-1 constrains form; frequency-minimality constrains how much data-machinery one rank-1 piece may host.**

## The CI function's output layer: leaky-hard sigmoids

One more implementation detail: The CI function must output values in $[0,1]$, with **exact** 0s and 1s achievable. "ablatable" must be expressible as literally $g=0$, or the importance penalty (which only vanishes at 0) could never be satisfied and minimality claims would always be slightly hedged. An ordinary sigmoid never reaches 0 or 1. So we use a **hard sigmoid** $\text{clamp}(x, 0, 1)$... which has a new problem: zero gradient outside $(0,1)$. A subcomponent pushed into the $g=0$ region can never come back — there's no gradient signal to resurrect it even when reconstruction needs it. (You've seen this disease before: dead SAE latents.)

The fix, `lower_leaky`, is a hard sigmoid with a **one-way leaky gradient** in the saturated-at-0 region: gradients that would *increase* $g$ (i.e. resurrect the subcomponent) pass through scaled by $\alpha = 0.01$; gradients that would push it further negative are blocked (pointless — the forward value is already 0, and drifting further negative only delays future resurrection). Above 1, gradients are blocked entirely.

There's a second subtlety: VPD computes *two* versions of the causal importances from the same pre-sigmoid values, used in different losses:

* `lower_leaky(x)` — used for the **masks** (reconstruction losses). Leak below 0, so dead subcomponents can be revived by reconstruction pressure.
* `upper_leaky(x)` — clamp with a linear leak *above 1* — used for the **importance penalty**. Leak above 1, so over-confident importance claims ($x > 1$) still feel sparsity pressure rather than sitting in a gradient-free plateau.

Each loss gets a gradient path into the region it needs to push against. Neat, right?

### Exercise - implement `lower_leaky` as a custom autograd function

> ```yaml
> Difficulty: 🔴🔴🔴⚪⚪
> Importance: 🔵🔵⚪⚪⚪
> 
> You should spend up to 20-30 minutes on this exercise. If you've never written a custom `torch.autograd.Function` (it isn't covered elsewhere in ARENA), budget the extra ten minutes for the refresher and help dropdowns and a skim of [PyTorch's extending-autograd notes](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/extending.html).
> ```

<details>
<summary>Refresher - the anatomy of a custom torch.autograd.Function</summary>

A `torch.autograd.Function` subclass defines one differentiable op by hand, as two static methods:

* `forward(ctx, *inputs)` computes the output with ordinary tensor maths (nothing inside it is tracked by autograd). `ctx` is a scratch object for passing state to the backward: tensors go through `ctx.save_for_backward(x)`, plain Python values can be attached directly (`ctx.alpha = alpha`).
* `backward(ctx, grad_output)` receives $\partial \mathcal{L} / \partial(\text{output})$ — same shape as the output — and must return $\partial \mathcal{L} / \partial(\text{input})$ for **each** input of `forward`, in order (`None` for non-differentiable inputs like a float hyperparameter). For an elementwise op the chain rule is just `grad_input = local_derivative * grad_output`, and writing a custom backward means choosing the `local_derivative` yourself. That freedom is the entire point here: we'll deliberately report a *nonzero* "derivative" in a region where the true derivative is zero.

You call it via `LowerLeakyHardSigmoid.apply(x, alpha)`, never `forward` directly — `apply` is what registers the op in the autograd graph.

</details>

Implement the forward and backward passes. Forward: `x.clamp(0, 1)`. Backward, given upstream gradient `grad_output` (and noting that pytorch convention means `grad_output < 0` ⟺ "the loss wants this output to increase"). All conditions below are elementwise:

* where `0 < x ≤ 1`: pass `grad_output` through unchanged.
* where `x ≤ 0`: pass `alpha * grad_output` at the positions where additionally `grad_output < 0` (resurrection), and 0 at the rest.
* where `x > 1`: 0.

Also implement `upper_leaky` (no custom autograd needed — compose differentiable ops: for $x>1$ return $1 + \alpha(x-1)$, else `clamp(x,0,1)`, and check you understand why native autograd gives the right gradient profile for it).

<details>
<summary>Help - I'm getting autograd errors / my backward signature is rejected.</summary>

Two classic `torch.autograd.Function` gotchas:

* `backward` must return **one gradient per input of `forward`** — and our forward takes `(x, alpha)`. `alpha` is a plain float with no gradient, so return the tuple `(grad, None)`.
* You can't read `x` in `backward` unless you stashed it: call `ctx.save_for_backward(x)` in `forward` and recover it with `(x,) = ctx.saved_tensors`. Non-tensor state like `alpha` goes on `ctx` directly (`ctx.alpha = alpha`).

Then the backward is just nested `torch.where`s over the three regions of `x`, with the $x \le 0$ region further split by the sign of `grad_output`.

## Why "in any combination" is the whole ballgame

We keep emphasising that unimportant subcomponents must be ablatable **in any combination** — not merely all-at-once. This requirement looks like a technicality. It is actually the load-bearing wall of the entire method, so let's stress-test your understanding of it. Work through these before opening the answers; they're the kind of thing interviewers at interp labs love.

**Question 1.** Suppose subcomponents $\theta_A$ and $\theta_B$ can be ablated *jointly* (both to zero simultaneously) without changing the output on input $x$, but ablating either one *alone* changes the output. Under VPD's definition, are they causally important on $x$? Should they be?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

They are important, and should be. The classic way this situation arises is cancellation: $\theta_A$ and $\theta_B$ push the output in opposite directions with equal strength on $x$ (e.g. one writes $+v$, the other $-v$ to the residual stream). Deleting both removes both pushes — net zero change. But the model *is* using them (each one's contribution is live machinery; remove one and you see it). A mask scheme that only tested all-at-once ablation would label both "unused" and hide this machinery from every downstream analysis. Interval masks catch it: independent partial scalings $m_A \ne m_B$ break the cancellation.

</details>

**Question 2** (the lookup-table catastrophe). Here is a decomposition that *perfectly* satisfies parameter faithfulness, gets a perfect reconstruction score under naive masking (mask = causal importance, no sampling), and achieves the minimum possible minimality score of $L_0 = 1$. For every datapoint $x_i$ in the training set, invent a fresh component $\theta_i$ chosen such that $f(x_i | \theta_i) = f(x_i | \theta)$, assign it $g=1$ on $x_i$ and $g=0$ elsewhere; add one final component $\theta_{\text{rest}} = \theta - \sum_i \theta_i$ with $g = 0$ everywhere. Why is this decomposition garbage, and exactly which part of the VPD objective kills it?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

It's garbage because it's a lookup table of the training set: the components are constructed from the *dataset*, with no reference to the model's internal structure at all (note how the construction never had to look inside $\theta$!). It memorises rather than explains; it won't generalise to new inputs, and its "components" are not mechanisms.

What kills it: **stochastic/adversarial sampling of the unimportant components' masks**. On datapoint $x_1$, every component except $\theta_1$ is labelled $g=0$, so the sampler is free to turn $\theta_2, \theta_3, \dots$ each *partially on* with independent random coefficients. The sum $\theta_1 + \sum_{i>1} m_i \theta_i$ is then a soup of unrelated parameter vectors — nowhere near anything that computes $f(x_1|\theta)$ — and reconstruction fails catastrophically. The only way to survive masks-in-any-combination is for claimed-unimportant components to *genuinely not interact* with the computation on that input, which is a structural property of the model's weights, not something you can fake from the dataset.

This is also the deep reason VPD resists feature splitting (a mild version of the same pathology) — and the paper makes the strong claim that this issue afflicts "a large fraction of the neural network subgraph identification literature": any method that identifies important subnetworks by optimising masks *without* adversarial/stochastic verification is vulnerable to exactly this spurious-subnetwork construction.

</details>

**Question 3.** VPD trains against masks optimised adversarially (PGD) to maximise reconstruction error. The paper reports their LM decomposition is robust to ~20 steps of adversarial optimisation but breaks down by ~160 steps. Should we conclude the decomposition has failed, and a perfect decomposition would be robust to unlimited adversarial pressure?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

Not necessarily — *complete* adversarial robustness isn't even desirable, and the reason is superposition itself. In a model computing in superposition, the mechanisms that are inactive on this input still each contribute a little *interference noise* to the output — small, sign-varying nudges that roughly cancel in aggregate. An honest decomposition assigns all those inactive mechanisms $g = 0$, individually correctly. But an unlimited adversary doesn't ablate them randomly: it can ablate *only the ones whose noise happened to push in one direction* while keeping the ones pushing the other way, de-correlating the cancellation and accumulating thousands of tiny nudges into a large output change. No dishonesty by the CI function is required for this attack to work — it exploits a real property of superposed computation, not a flaw in the decomposition.

This is also why the adversary is *handicapped* in practice: in both the paper's eval and the `pgd_recon_loss` you'll build in section 2, the adversarial mask sources are **shared across the whole batch**. A batch-shared adversary can only exploit *systematic* defects (a subcomponent wrongly claimed ablatable everywhere); it can't fine-tune the noise cancellation per datapoint. Robustness to a moderate, batch-shared adversary is the paper's working target — strong enough to kill lookup-table pathologies and dishonest claims, without demanding the decomposition defend the un-defendable. Exactly how much robustness a "fully faithful" decomposition should exhibit is live research territory.

## Putting it together: the five-term loss

Here's the complete VPD objective, with each term tagged by the desideratum it serves. You've now implemented or reasoned about every one of them:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{VPD}} = \underbrace{\beta_1 \mathcal{L}_{\text{adversarial-recon}} + \beta_2 \mathcal{L}_{\text{stochastic-recon}}}_{\text{mechanistic faithfulness}} + \underbrace{\beta_3 \mathcal{L}_{\text{importance-minimality}}}_{\text{minimality}} + \underbrace{\beta_4 \mathcal{L}_{\text{frequency-minimality}}}_{\text{simplicity}} + \underbrace{\beta_5 \mathcal{L}_{\text{Delta-L2}}}_{\text{parameter faithfulness}}$$

SPD is the same objective minus the adversarial and frequency terms. A useful mental model of the training dynamic:

* The **reconstruction terms** are the *verifier*: they make dishonesty (claiming $g$ too low) expensive.
* The **importance penalty** is the *prosecutor*: it makes conservatism (claiming $g$ too high) expensive.
* The **frequency penalty** is *anti-trust law*: it makes hosting multiple mechanisms in one subcomponent expensive.
* The **delta penalty** stops machinery hiding outside the subcomponents entirely.

In section 2, you'll watch these pressures carve a toy model into its ground-truth mechanisms — and then you'll remove the most load-bearing one (honest mask sampling), train a subtly fraudulent decomposition, and build the adversarial auditor that exposes it.

Time to build the thing. In this section you'll implement the full decomposition pipeline from scratch — about 150 lines of core code — and use it to decompose the toy model of superposition. This replicates the headline experiment of the SPD paper, and it's the ideal testbed because *we know the answer*: the TMS model's mechanisms are visible to the naked eye, so we can grade the decomposition against ground truth.

## The target model, and what "ground truth mechanisms" means here

Our target is the TMS architecture from the SPD paper — the same model section 1 recapped (and which 1.5.4 trains, if you did that day), with one cosmetic difference (the down and up projections are stored as two `nn.Linear`s, `linear1` and `linear2`, with tied weights $W_2 = W_1^\top$):

$$\hat{x} = \text{ReLU}(W^\top W x + b), \qquad W \in \mathbb{R}^{2 \times 5}$$

Five sparse features (each active independently with probability 0.05, magnitude $U(0,1)$), squeezed through 2 hidden dimensions. Trained well, the columns of $W$ form the familiar pentagon.

What are this model's mechanisms? Each feature $i$ gets embedded by $W$'s $i$-th column and read back out by the same column transposed. So the natural candidate is: **mechanism $i$ = "the part of the weights that stores and retrieves feature $i$"**, i.e. the rank-1 matrices

$$W^{(i)}_1 = W_{[:, i]}\, e_i^\top \quad \text{(in linear1)}, \qquad W^{(i)}_2 = e_i\, W_{[:, i]}^\top \quad \text{(in linear2)}$$

These sum to $W_1$ and $W_2$ respectively (since $W = \sum_i W_{[:,i]} e_i^\top$), there are 5 of them per matrix (more than rank 2!), and on an input where only feature $i$ is active, you can ablate the other four with almost no effect on the output (the "almost" is real and we'll come back to it). Note: nobody tells SPD any of this. It sees only the weights and samples of model behaviour. If it's working, it should *discover* that the natural number of live subcomponents per matrix is 5, and that their read/write directions match the feature embeddings — even though we'll give it capacity for $C = 20$.

Run the cell below to train the target model (~20s on CPU). We train until the loss matches the known optimum and assert the pentagon structure.

## The `ComponentLinear` wrapper

The workhorse of the whole method is a module that can stand in for an `nn.Linear` and run in two modes:

* **`"target"` mode**: behave *exactly* like the original linear layer (using the frozen original weight), but **cache the input** `x` — the CI function will need it.
* **`"component"` mode**: compute the output through the masked subcomponents plus the masked delta:

$$\text{out} = \big((x V) \odot m\big)\, U + \text{bias} + m_\Delta \cdot (x\, \Delta^\top)$$

where $m$ is the per-subcomponent mask `(batch, C)` and $m_\Delta$ the scalar-per-input delta mask `(batch,)`.

The training loop will flip modes: one target-mode pass to get the reference output and the cached activations (→ CI values), then masked component-mode passes for the reconstruction losses.

### Exercise - implement `ComponentLinear`

> ```yaml
> Difficulty: 🔴🔴🔴⚪⚪
> Importance: 🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵
> 
> You should spend up to 20-25 minutes on this exercise.
> ```

Implement `__init__` and `forward`. Details to get right:

* Keep a string attribute `self.mode`, `"target"` or `"component"` — the training loop flips it externally (`w.mode = "component"`), so use these exact names.
* Store the original weight and bias as **buffers** (`register_buffer`), not parameters — they're frozen; only `V` and `U` train.
* Init: `V ~ N(0, 1/sqrt(d_in))`, `U ~ N(0, 1/sqrt(C))` (so the product starts at sensible scale).
* `weight_delta()` should reuse your section 1 `weight_delta` semantics: `W_target - einops.einsum(V, U, "d_in C, C d_out -> d_out d_in")`.
* In component mode, `self.mask` and `self.delta_mask` are set externally by the training loop before the forward call. Don't forget the bias (unmasked — we don't decompose biases).
* In target mode, cache `x.detach()` in `self.last_input`.
* Devices: don't worry about them inside the class — `V`/`U` are created wherever you build them, and the given training scaffold calls `.to(device)` on each wrapper after construction, which moves parameters and buffers together. Just never create fresh tensors out of thin air in `forward` (derive everything from `x` and the stored tensors).

<details>
<summary>Refresher - PyTorch's weight layout, <code>F.linear</code>, and buffers vs parameters</summary>

Two PyTorch facts this exercise leans on:

* An `nn.Linear(d_in, d_out)` stores `weight` with shape `(d_out, d_in)` and computes `x @ weight.T + bias`; `F.linear(x, W, b)` is the functional form of exactly that, handy here because you hold the weight yourself. This layout is also why section 1's reconstructed weight is `(V @ U).T`: code-`U` is stored transposed (shape `(C, d_out)`), so `V @ U` comes out as `(d_in, d_out)` and needs the final `.T` to land in PyTorch's `(d_out, d_in)` convention.
* `register_buffer("name", tensor)` stores a tensor on the module so it travels with `.to(device)` and `state_dict()`, but it isn't a parameter: no gradient, not returned by `.parameters()`, so the optimiser never touches it. Exactly the right home for the frozen `W_target` and `bias` — and it accepts `None`, which handles a bias-free layer gracefully.

<summary>Help - I'm not sure how the masked component forward should broadcast.</summary>

`x` is `(batch, d_in)`, `V` is `(d_in, C)`, so `einops.einsum(x, self.V, "... d_in, d_in C -> ... C")` is `(batch, C)` — one inner activation per subcomponent. `self.mask` is also `(batch, C)`: elementwise multiply to get masked activations. Then `einops.einsum(inner * self.mask, self.U, "... C, C d_out -> ... d_out")` gives `(batch, d_out)`. The delta path: `F.linear(x, self.weight_delta())` is `(batch, d_out)`, and `self.delta_mask` is `(batch,)`, so unsqueeze to `(batch, 1)` to scale per-example.

Sanity check to do in your head: with `mask` all ones and `delta_mask` all ones, component mode equals target mode *exactly* (the delta term fills in whatever the subcomponents miss). With `delta_mask` zero, component mode is the pure rank-1 reconstruction. The test checks both.

## The causal importance function

For toy models, the CI function is charmingly small: **each subcomponent gets its own tiny MLP** that looks *only at that subcomponent's own inner activation* — a scalar! — and predicts ablatability:

$$g_c = \text{lower\_leaky}\big(\text{MLP}_c(a_c)\big), \qquad a_c = (\vec{V}_c)^\top x, \qquad \text{MLP}_c: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}^{16} \to \mathbb{R}$$

(For the LM in section 3, Goodfire instead used one big shared transformer reading all layers' inputs at once — a subcomponent's ablatability there can depend on context, e.g. "this copula-verb subcomponent only matters if there was an 'it' earlier". For TMS, own-activation is enough.)

To run $C$ independent tiny MLPs efficiently we batch their weights: a `ParallelLinear` with weight `(C, d_in, d_out)` applied via einsum, so all $C$ MLPs run in one op.

Implement `ParallelLinear.forward` (einsum is your friend: `"... C i, C i o -> ... C o"`), then `CIFunction.forward`, which maps the layer input `x` to `(ci_lower, ci_upper)`:

1. inner activations: `a = einops.einsum(x, V.detach(), "... d_in, d_in C -> ... C")` (detach V so the CI function's gradient doesn't move the subcomponents),
2. unsqueeze to `(..., C, 1)`, pass through `self.layer1`, apply `F.gelu`, pass through `self.layer2`, squeeze to `(..., C)`,
3. return both `lower_leaky(pre)` and `upper_leaky(pre)` (from section 1).

<details>
<summary>Refresher - reading the einsum pattern</summary>

In `einops.einsum(x, w, "... C d_in, C d_in d_out -> ... C d_out")`: an axis named in the inputs but absent from the output (`d_in`) gets multiplied-and-summed away — that's the matrix multiply; an axis shared between both inputs *and* kept in the output (`C`) is matched index-by-index, which is exactly what makes this $C$ independent linear maps rather than one big one; `...` stands for any number of leading batch dims. (ARENA's chapter 0 prerequisites cover einops in depth, if you want more than this one pattern.) Don't forget `+ self.bias` afterwards — shapes `(..., C, d_out)` and `(C, d_out)` broadcast correctly as-is.

`ComponentLinear` decomposes a single layer; `CIFunction` gates one. A decomposition of a whole *model* needs both for every decomposed layer, so we bundle them into one module — as the reference does (Goodfire's `ComponentModel` owns both its `components` and its `ci_fn`).

At construction `WrappedModel` swaps a `ComponentLinear` in for each target `nn.Linear` (**in place**, recorded in `self.wrappers`) and builds one `CIFunction` per layer (`self.ci_fns`). Its `causal_importances(batch)` then does the whole CI step in one call: a target-mode forward to refresh each wrapper's cached `last_input`, then each layer's CI function over that input, returning `target_out` and the `(ci_lower, ci_upper)` dicts.

The install is **idempotent** — re-wrapping an existing `ComponentLinear` reuses it — so these cells survive re-runs. (One wrinkle: `nn.ModuleDict` keys can't contain `.`, so the gates register under flattened paths while `self.ci_fns` keeps the originals; registering them is what lets one `wrapped.to(device)` move components and gates together.)

`__init__` and `forward` are given — they're plumbing (install the wrappers, build a `CIFunction` per layer, delegate the forward). You implement `causal_importances(batch)`, which is the part that matters: put every wrapper in target mode, run one forward (caching inputs), then for each layer call its CI function on that wrapper's `last_input` and `V`, collecting the outputs into `ci_lower` / `ci_upper`. Return `(target_out, ci_lower, ci_upper)`.

<details>
<summary>Help - the CI-function call</summary>

`self.ci_fns[name](w.last_input, w.V)` returns `(ci_lower, ci_upper)` for that layer: `w.last_input` is the input cached by the target-mode forward you just ran, and `w.V` its read-directions (the CI function detaches `V` itself). Collect into two dicts keyed by layer name.

## The losses, and the training loop

Now we wire it up, following the recipe of the original `pd-tms` experiment. We decompose both `linear1` and `linear2` with $C = 20$ subcomponents each (4× more capacity than the 5 we expect to be used — deliberately, to test the no-feature-splitting claim).

Two reconstruction losses, both using your `sample_stochastic_masks`:

* **`stochastic_recon_loss`** — replace **all** decomposed layers with masked components simultaneously; MSE between the result and the target model's output.
* **`stochastic_recon_layerwise_loss`** — replace **one layer at a time** (the other layer runs in target mode), summing MSEs. This gives each layer a cleaner training signal early on, when the other layer's components are still rubbish.

Plus your `faithfulness_loss` on the deltas and `importance_minimality_loss` on the **upper-leaky** CI values (`ci_upper`), with its `p` and `beta` read straight from `SPDConfig`. For TMS that's $p=1$ (small models don't need the $p<1$ annealing) and $\beta=0$ (the frequency term off, so it reduces to the plain $L_p$ penalty) — `beta` lives in the config so this is the one place you'd flip the frequency term on for a larger model.

And one detail you'd be unlikely to guess: a short **faithfulness warmup** before the main loop — a few hundred steps optimising *only* $\|\Delta\|^2$, so the subcomponents start as a valid (if arbitrary) factorisation of the weights rather than noise. Decomposition then proceeds as a *re-arrangement* of a faithful factorisation instead of a from-scratch fit.

Here's the whole step you're about to assemble, with each loss tagged by its role from section 1:

### Exercise - implement the two reconstruction losses

> ```yaml
> Difficulty: 🔴🔴🔴⚪⚪
> Importance: 🔵🔵🔵🔵⚪
> 
> You should spend up to 10-15 minutes on this exercise.
> ```

We've given you the mode-flipping helpers. Implement `stochastic_recon_loss` and `stochastic_recon_layerwise_loss`. Each takes the model (with `ComponentLinear`s installed), the input batch, the target output, and the dict of `ci_lower` tensors; samples fresh masks; runs masked forward pass(es); returns MSE(s) against `target_out`.

One hard requirement: **leave the wrappers in target mode when you return** — wrap the masked forward in `try: ... finally: clear_masks(wrappers)`. Masks have the batch shape baked in, so a loss function that forgets to clean up plants a time bomb: some *later* cell, run with a different batch size, explodes with a confusing broadcast error (or worse, silently computes through stale masks). Every given cell in the rest of this chapter assumes wrappers come back in target mode.

<details>
<summary>Refresher - why MSE here, when section 3 uses KL?</summary>

The reconstruction loss must measure "did the masked model's *behaviour* change?" in whatever space the model's output lives in. TMS outputs a reconstruction vector in feature space, and the target model was itself trained with MSE — so MSE between masked and unmasked outputs is the matching metric. A language model outputs a probability distribution over next tokens, so section 3 measures KL(target ‖ masked) between the two predicted distributions instead: MSE on raw logits would punish differences (like a constant shift across the whole vocabulary) that don't change the predicted distribution at all.

### Exercise - complete the SPD training loop

> ```yaml
> Difficulty: 🔴🔴🔴⚪⚪
> Importance: 🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵
> 
> You should spend up to 25-30 minutes on this exercise.
> ```

We've written the scaffold (`decompose_tms` below); you fill in the marked steps inside the training loop: the CI computation (one `wrapped.causal_importances(batch)` call), the four losses, and the weighted total. Hyperparameters are in `SPDConfig` and match the original `pd-tms` experiment config (C=20, lr 1e-3 cosine, importance coeff 3e-3 with p=1 and β=0, 200 warmup steps at lr 1e-2 with weight decay 0.1). Training takes ~4-5 minutes on GPU (10k steps, batch 4096); don't shorten below ~5k steps — at 2k the decomposition reliably hasn't disentangled yet.

<details>
<summary>Help - the order of operations in the loop, and the two classic silent failures.</summary>

Per step: (1) `target_out, ci_lower, ci_upper = wrapped.causal_importances(batch)` — the target-mode forward and per-layer CI in one call; (2) the four losses — faithfulness on the deltas, importance on **`ci_upper`** (passing `p=cfg.p, beta=cfg.beta`), both recon losses with masks built from **`ci_lower`**; (3) weighted sum per the config coefficients.

The two mix-ups that *won't crash* but will quietly ruin the run:

* Importance penalty on `ci_lower` instead of `ci_upper`: `lower_leaky` has zero gradient above 1, so confident importance claims feel no sparsity pressure — you'll end the run with far too many alive subcomponents.
* Masks from `ci_upper` instead of `ci_lower`: dead subcomponents can never be resurrected by reconstruction pressure (no leak below 0), and mask values can exceed 1.

</details>

While it trains, watch the `L0` readout on the progress bar: the mean number of subcomponents per input with causal importance above 0.1 (computed from `ci_lower`), summed over both matrices. It starts at 40 — the CI output bias is initialised to +1, so all 20 subcomponents in both layers begin by claiming importance on every input — and a healthy run drives it down to roughly 0.5 by the end. That final number is just the dataset talking: each feature is active with probability 0.05, so an average input has 0.25 active features, each needing one subcomponent in each of the two matrices.

## Did it find the mechanisms?

Three plots, three claims to verify:

**1. Alive subcomponents.** Of the 20 subcomponents per matrix, how many ever matter? Count subcomponents whose causal importance exceeds 0.1 anywhere in a large batch. *Claim: ~5 per matrix, despite capacity for 20 — no feature splitting.*

**2. Read/write directions match the features.** For `linear1`, each alive subcomponent's read vector $\vec{V}_c \in \mathbb{R}^5$ should align with one feature axis $e_i$, and its write vector $\vec{U}_c \in \mathbb{R}^2$ with that feature's embedding $W_{[:,i]}$. *Claim: across all 20 read-direction rows, only ~5 are non-blank, and those form a (signed) permutation of the feature axes.*

**3. Causal importance tracks feature activity.** Feed one-hot inputs $e_i$: subcomponent $\sigma(i)$ should get $g \approx 1$ and all others $g \approx 0$. *Claim: in the all-20 CI heatmap, ~5 columns light up as a permuted identity and the other ~15 stay dark.*

Expected output for claim 1: two lines of the form `linear1: 5 alive subcomponents of 20` (the assert tolerates 3-8; if you land outside that range, its error message names the likely bug, and the dropdown after the plots covers near-misses like a duplicated or split subcomponent).

Sit with how different this is from the SAE version of this experiment (1.5.4's, if you did it): there, training an SAE on this same model recovers the five feature *directions in activation space*; here you've recovered five *pieces of algorithm*, each pinned to specific weights — and you also learned how many mechanisms there are, because 15 of your 20 subcomponents died rather than splitting.

<details>
<summary>My decomposition mostly works but a couple of subcomponents are duplicated / a feature is split across two subcomponents — is this a bug?</summary>

Not necessarily — SPD on TMS occasionally converges to local optima with a split or duplicated mechanism, especially with unlucky seeds (the original repo's runs are seed-sensitive too). Try a different seed. If *many* components are alive, check your importance-minimality loss is applied to `ci_upper` (not `ci_lower` — no gradient above 1 means no sparsity pressure on confident claims) and that your masks use `ci_lower`.

</details>

**Optional 5-minute ablation** (recommended — it's one config change each, and *predict before you run*): (a) set `coeff_imp = 0` and retrain — how many subcomponents stay alive, and what does each look like? (b) set `faithfulness_warmup_steps = 0` — does it still converge, and how does the faithfulness loss curve differ? You've now seen the prosecutor and the warm start each earn their place.

<details>
<summary>Question - why is it fine that the "almost" in "almost no effect" is nonzero? (I.e. ablating other features' subcomponents on a one-feature input does change the output slightly.)</summary>

Because the *target model itself* has interference between features — the pentagon directions aren't orthogonal, so feature $i$'s reconstruction includes small contributions through other features' directions, partially cleaned up by the ReLU and bias. The decomposition's job is to be faithful to the model *as it is*, interference included. This shows up as causal importances slightly above 0 for "inactive" subcomponents, and it's honest: those weights really do brush against the computation. In fact this is a feature of the method — the continuous $g$ values quantify partial participation rather than forcing a binary verdict.

## Breaking it: why the sampling matters (and the VPD upgrade)

You implemented stochastic mask sampling because section 1 argued that *verifying ablatability claims* is what makes the method honest. Let's now actually catch a dishonest decomposition. We'll train a lazy variant — **CI-masked training** — where the reconstruction loss just uses the causal importances directly as masks ($m = g$, no sampling). This is the "naive masking" that the paper warns about: the optimiser only ever has to make *one specific* mask combination work, instead of all of them.

Then we'll audit both decompositions with an **adversarial evaluator**: projected gradient descent over the allowed mask space, climbing the reconstruction loss.

### Exercise - implement `pgd_recon_loss`

Implement adversarial mask search, following the paper's eval protocol:

1. Initialise per-layer **sources** $s \in [0,1]^{C+1}$ uniformly at random (the extra slot is the delta mask), shared across the batch (shape `(1, C+1)`, broadcast).
2. For `n_steps` iterations: form masks $m = g + (1-g) \cdot s_{[:C]}$ and $m_\Delta = s_{[C]}$, forward, compute MSE recon loss, take gradients **with respect to the sources**, and update with sign-SGD ascent: $s \leftarrow \text{clamp}(s + \eta \cdot \text{sign}(\nabla_s \mathcal{L}), 0, 1)$.
3. After the last update, recompute the loss at the final sources (the loop's `loss` is one step stale) and return it **detached**. `pgd_recon_loss` is an *audit*, not a training term — you read it with `.item()` to measure worst-case reconstruction, so nothing backprops through it; the only gradients are the per-step ones w.r.t. the sources. Build the sources with `device=batch.device` **and** `dtype=batch.dtype` (else `model(batch)` crashes on GPU or mismatches dtype).

As a shape map (the leading $1$ is the batch-broadcast axis, $B$ the batch, $g$ the causal importances):

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{source}\quad & s \in [0,1]^{\,1\times(C+1)} \qquad\text{(one vector, shared across the batch)}\\[3pt]
\text{split}\quad & s \;=\; \big[\;\underbrace{s_{:,\,0:C}}_{1\times C}\ \big|\ \underbrace{s_{:,\,C}}_{1\times 1}\;\big]\\[3pt]
\text{component masks}\quad & m \;=\; g + (1-g)\odot s_{:,\,0:C}\ \in\ [0,1]^{\,B\times C}\\[3pt]
\text{delta mask}\quad & m_\Delta \;=\; s_{:,\,C}\ \in\ [0,1]^{\,B}
\end{aligned}
$$

The masks come out $B\times C$ rather than $1\times C$ because $g$ is per-example: the *source* is shared, but each example's legal interval $[g,1]$ differs, so the broadcast lands different masks per row. PGD only ever updates the $1\times(C+1)$ source.

<details>
<summary>Refresher - projected gradient descent and sign-SGD</summary>

**PGD** is constrained optimisation at its bluntest: take a gradient step, then *project* back onto the feasible set, i.e. replace the iterate with the nearest feasible point. Our feasible set is the box $[0,1]^{C+1}$, and projection onto a box is coordinatewise clamping — hence the clamp after every update. **Sign-SGD** replaces the gradient with its elementwise sign, so every coordinate moves by exactly `step_size` per iteration regardless of how the gradients happen to be scaled; it's the standard inner-loop update in the adversarial-examples literature, and the right tool for a short fixed budget — 20 steps of size 0.1 can traverse the whole box, with no optimiser state to warm up (an adaptive optimiser like Adam would spend most of a 20-step budget calibrating its moment estimates). The *persistent*-PGD variant mentioned at the end of this section keeps sources alive across training steps; there, with thousands of updates per source, Adam earns its keep.

</details>

Note how the parameterisation guarantees the adversary stays legal: whatever $s$ it picks, $m = g + (1-g)s$ lands in $[g, 1]$. The adversary can only exploit freedom the CI function *claimed* was safe. (`t.enable_grad()` context — we're at eval time; and make sure only the sources get gradients, e.g. compute CI values once outside the loop and `.detach()` them.)

Why are the sources shaped `(1, C+1)` — shared across the batch — rather than per-example? This is deliberate and important (it's the paper's eval protocol too): a batch-shared adversary can only exploit *systematic* dishonesty, like a subcomponent claimed ablatable everywhere that actually matters. A per-example adversary could additionally tune each datapoint's superposition interference noise (recall the section 1 discussion of why complete adversarial robustness is neither achievable nor desirable), which would punish even perfectly honest decompositions.

Train the lazy variant yourself: implement `decompose_tms_ci_masked` by copying your `decompose_tms` and replacing both stochastic reconstruction losses with a single CI-masked one — masks = `ci_lower` used directly, delta mask = 0, no sampling at all. Give this single loss the combined weight `cfg.coeff_stoch + cfg.coeff_layerwise`, so total reconstruction pressure matches the honest run. Train it on a fresh copy of the target model, then produce the audit table below (the evaluation cell is given): for both decompositions, (a) CI-masked recon loss, (b) stochastic recon loss, (c) PGD recon loss at 20 steps, (d) mean L0 — as on the training progress bar, the mean over inputs of the number of subcomponents with causal importance above 0.1, summed over both matrices.

Predict the result before you run it! Which cells of the table will give the game away?

<summary>What you should find, and the lesson</summary>

The lazy decomposition looks *better* in the CI-masked column (it trained on exactly that; in our reference runs ~1.5e-4 vs the honest ~2.7e-4) — by its own scorecard, it's the superior decomposition. The stochastic column already shows cracks (~10-25× worse), and the PGD column blows it open: across seeds, the honest decomposition's PGD loss stays ~5e-4 while the lazy one's lands between 3e-2 and 1.6e-1 — **two to three orders of magnitude worse**. The adversary finds legal mask combinations that badly corrupt reconstruction. The lazy CI function has been claiming subcomponents are ablatable when they aren't — nobody ever called its bluff during training.

There's a second tell worth noticing: count the alive subcomponents. The honest run keeps exactly 10 (5 per matrix — the ground truth); the lazy runs keep 12-22, padding the decomposition with spurious components that exist to game the unaudited objective. Cleaner-looking metrics, messier actual structure.

This is the TMS-scale version of one of the paper's sharpest points. Their LM attribution graphs pruned with CI-masking alone contain ~6 subcomponents and look beautifully clean; pruning under adversarial sampling instead keeps ~150 subcomponents for the same behaviour — and even *that* graph isn't fully robust (the target's 0.586 probability on the correct token drops to 0.443 under a 4-step adversary). Meanwhile the 6-subcomponent story scores *better than the target model itself* on the task — a tell-tale sign of optimisation gaming rather than explanation. The paper argues this failure mode infects much of the published subnetwork/circuit-pruning literature: **a mask-optimised "circuit" that was never audited under combinatorial ablations is a claim, not a finding.**

Going from "audit with PGD at eval" to "train against PGD" is exactly the SPD → VPD upgrade. For TMS, stochastic sampling is usually already enough (the mask space is small); for the 67M-parameter LM, it wasn't — hence VPD. The paper's persistent-PGD training (adversarial sources kept and refined across steps, Adam on the sources) is a bonus exercise below.

# 3️⃣ Interpreting a Real LM's Parameters
'''

# ! CELL TYPE: markdown
# ! FILTERS: []
# ! TAGS: []

r'''
You've built the method and verified it on a model with known ground truth. Now we get to play with the real thing: Goodfire released the trained decomposition from the paper — their 4-layer, 67M parameter LM trained on the Pile, with all 24 weight matrices (attention QKVO + MLP up/down, layers 0-3; embeddings excluded) decomposed into 38,912 rank-1 subcomponents, of which ~10,000 are "alive". This is the largest public parameter decomposition in existence, and almost everything about it is still unexplored — by the end of this section you'll be one of maybe a few dozen people ever to have poked at a language model's algorithm through its parameters.

A quick tour of what we're loading:

| | Target model | Decomposition |
|---|---|---|
| What | 4-layer decoder-only LM (RoPE, RMSNorm, GELU, 6 heads of $d_{head}=128$, $d_{model}=768$) | $U^l, V^l$ for 24 matrices, $C=512$-$3584$ per matrix, + the CI transformer |
| Trained on | Pile (uncopyrighted subset), val CE 2.71 | VPD objective, 400k steps |
| Source | W&B run `t-9d2b8f02` | W&B run `s-55ea3f9b` |

The CI function here is not the per-component MLP from section 2 — it's a full 8-block bidirectional transformer that reads the (RMS-normed) inputs of all 24 matrices at once, so causal importance can be *context-dependent*: the same subcomponent activation can be important in one sentence and ablatable in another. Keep this in mind throughout — it's what makes findings like "this subcomponent is important on copula verbs *only when preceded by 'it'/'there'*" expressible at all.

## Loading the decomposition

Run the cells below to download (~3.2GB, anonymous — no accounts needed; skipped if cached) and load everything. `lm_utils.py` is a self-contained reimplementation of the target model and CI transformer, verified against Goodfire's reference implementation to ~1e-5 (see its docstring for the receipts). Stay in fp32: the CI values are threshold-sensitive enough that bf16 visibly flips ablatability decisions.

Then comes one of the most satisfying moments of this exercise set: **installing the decomposition is done with the `ComponentLinear` class you wrote in section 2, unchanged.** The same ~40 lines that decomposed a 7-parameter toy model wrap a 67M-parameter LM, because a parameter decomposition *is just weights* — there's nothing scale-specific about the machinery.

One naming convention to fix in your head now, because two formats coexist: code objects (`wrappers`, `components`, the CI dicts) are keyed by **full module paths** like `h.1.attn.k_proj`, while the paper (and Goodfire's published autointerp data, via `utils.fetch_component_info`) uses **short names** like `1.attn.k` — so "subcomponent `1.attn.k:119`" means index 119 of `wrappers["h.1.attn.k_proj"]`. Functions you write in this section should take the full path.

### Exercise - reproduce the masking-strategy CE table

> ```yaml
> Difficulty: 🔴🔴⚪⚪⚪
> Importance: 🔵🔵🔵⚪⚪
> 
> You should spend up to 20-25 minutes on this exercise.
> ```

For a batch of Pile validation sequences, compute next-token CE under five strategies ("next-token CE" means exactly: cross-entropy of `logits[:, :-1]` against `tokens[:, 1:]`, flattened over batch and sequence — the standard off-by-one; write a small `next_token_ce` helper first). **Delta-handling differs by strategy and you must match it to reproduce the numbers** (this follows the reference implementation): the stochastic strategy routes through the delta with a $U(0,1)$ mask, all others set the delta mask to 0.

| strategy | subcomponent masks | delta mask | paper CE |
|---|---|---|---|
| target model | — | — | 2.71 |
| unmasked | all 1 | 0 | 2.72 |
| stochastic | $g + (1-g)u$ | $U(0,1)$ | 2.84 |
| CI-as-masks | $g$ | 0 | 2.99 |
| rounded | $\mathbb{1}[g > 0.5]$ | 0 | 3.02 |

Small deviations from batch noise are expected; within ~0.05 of each is success.

<details>
<summary>Refresher - the masking machinery you're reusing</summary>

* $g$ in the table is shorthand for `ci_lower[module]`, shape `(batch, seq, C)` with values in $[0, 1]$: the CI transformer's per-token claim about how far each subcomponent's mask can safely be turned down. The `lm_ci_lower` helper (defined above) runs the target-mode forward pass and the CI transformer in one call and returns `(logits, ci_lower)` — those logits are exactly what the "target model" row needs, so each chunk costs you one target forward plus one masked forward per remaining strategy.
* `sample_stochastic_masks(ci)` returns `(mask, delta_mask)`: `mask` $= g + (1-g)u$ with $u \sim U(0,1)$ elementwise (each entry uniform on $[g, 1]$, the interval the CI value claims is harmless), and `delta_mask` $\sim U(0,1)$ with shape `ci.shape[:-1]` — here `(batch, seq)`, one scalar per token.
* The **delta** is each wrapper's rank-residual `weight_delta()` $= W_{\text{target}} - (VU)^\top$: whatever part of the original weights the $C$ rank-1 subcomponents fail to capture. Its mask scales that path's output per token, and "delta mask 0" means the forward pass runs purely through the (masked) subcomponents.
* `set_masks(wrappers, masks, delta_masks)` puts every wrapper into component mode with those per-token masks; `clear_masks(wrappers)` returns them all to target mode (plain $W$ forward, which also refreshes `last_input`). Masks left installed silently corrupt the *next* forward pass — clear them in a `finally:` if you want that mistake to be impossible.

</details>

Then two summary statistics: the **L0** (mean number of subcomponents with CI > 0 per token — the paper reports ~205, about 2% of alive subcomponents) and the **alive count** (subcomponents with CI > $10^{-6}$ anywhere in your batch — paper: ~10,000 of 38,912). That second number is the feature-splitting story from section 1 made concrete: given 4× more capacity than it uses, the decomposition left the surplus dead instead of splitting. While the forward passes run, form an opinion: is 205-mechanisms-per-token a *lot* or a *little*? What would you have guessed for "how much machinery does predicting one Pile token take"?

## What does a subcomponent do? Browsing causal importances

The basic epistemic act with an SAE was "look at max-activating dataset examples". The parameter-decomposition analogue: run text through the model, record each subcomponent's **causal importance** per token (and its inner activation), and look at the tokens where CI is high.

Goodfire published their harvest of exactly this — per-subcomponent autointerp labels, reasoning, and max-activating examples — as static JSON, and `utils.fetch_component_info` pulls it (no GPU or W&B). Start by browsing the two subcomponents that star in the paper's attention analysis:

Write `ci_per_token(prompts, module) -> (ci_values, tokens)` (`module` is a full path like `"h.1.attn.k_proj"`; tokenize, run the target model caching `last_input`s, run the CI transformer, slice out the module) and use it on prompts of your own devising:

* `1.attn.k:119` — confirm the "punctuation, brackets, newlines" story on text you wrote yourself (the published examples are Pile text; does it also fire on, say, Python code?).
* `1.attn.q:308` — important on copula verbs ("is", "was", "seems", "appeared"...) but — check this explicitly! — **not on all of them**. Compare "There is a problem" / "It is unusual" against "She is a doctor". The autointerp reasoning gestures at this ("often when preceded by 'there' or 'it'"), but your CI values can turn that "often" into a clean conditional claim, and a *causal* one: the subcomponent's raw activation is high on `"She is"` too — it's specifically the causal importance that's gated on the preceding context. The CI transformer is doing something genuinely contextual here, which we'll explain mechanistically below.

<summary>What you should see</summary>

With a display threshold of 0.1, `1.attn.k:119` should highlight the punctuation skeleton of your prompt — `(`, `)`, `;`, `.`, the newline — while ordinary words pass through unmarked: the autointerp story confirmed on text the labeller never saw. For `1.attn.q:308`, the "is" in "There is a problem with this." and "It is unusual to see." should come back with high CI, while the "is" in "She is a doctor now." stays below threshold — turning the label's "often" into a clean conditional claim. For the full contrast, also print the raw inner activation on the same prompts (`einops.einsum(wrappers[module].last_input, wrappers[module].V, "batch seq d_in, d_in C -> batch seq C")[..., 308]`, after a target-mode forward): it's high on *all three* "is" tokens. Activation says "this direction is present in the input"; CI says "ablating this subcomponent would matter here" — and only the second is gated on the preceding context.

## Decomposing attention: subcomponents span heads

Now the paper's most distinctive contribution. Recall the QK circuit from 1.2 (induction heads): head $h$'s attention scores are $Z^h = \varphi\, W_Q^{h\top} W_K^h\, \varphi^\top$, and the combined matrix $W^h_{QK} = W_Q^{h\top} W_K^h$ tells you what the head "looks for". The classic analysis stops there, treating each head as one unit.

<details>
<summary>Refresher - the QK circuit (if 1.2 is hazy, or you skipped it)</summary>

The induction-heads day (1.2) is optional background; here is everything this section actually uses. Each attention head $h$ computes a query $q_t = W_Q^h \varphi_t$ at every position $t$ and a key $k_{t'} = W_K^h \varphi_{t'}$ at every position $t'$, where $\varphi$ is the layer's input. The pre-softmax **attention score** from $t$ to $t'$ is the dot product $q_t \cdot k_{t'}$ (scaled by $1/\sqrt{d_{head}}$); softmax over $t'$ turns each query's row of scores into its attention pattern. Writing the dot product out as $\varphi_t^\top W_Q^{h\top} W_K^h\, \varphi_{t'}$ shows that the two projections only ever act through the combined matrix $W^h_{QK} = W_Q^{h\top} W_K^h$ — a bilinear form scoring "how much does context like $\varphi_t$ want to look at content like $\varphi_{t'}$". Analysing $W_{QK}$ rather than $W_Q, W_K$ separately is the "QK circuit" view. In this model the six heads' projections are stacked into single $768 \times 768$ matrices ($W_Q$, $W_K$), and those stacked matrices are what got decomposed.

</details>

But VPD decomposed $W_Q$ and $W_K$ themselves — the full matrices, concatenated across heads — into rank-1 subcomponents. Substituting the decompositions:

$$W_{QK}^h = \sum_{c, c'} \vec{V}_{Q,c} \left( (\vec{U}_{Q,c}^{h})^\top \vec{U}_{K,c'}^h \right) (\vec{V}_{K,c'})^{\top}$$

(Throughout this section, $\varphi$ denotes the activations that actually feed $W_Q$ and $W_K$ — i.e. the **post-RMSNorm** residual stream, what your `ComponentLinear.last_input` caches. Using the raw residual stream will silently give wrong magnitudes and signs.)

Read this carefully — it's the key equation of the section. The QK circuit of *every head* is a sum over **pairs of subcomponents** $(c, c')$. Each pair contributes a rank-1 "looker": query-side read direction $\vec{V}_{Q,c}$ (what context triggers looking), key-side read direction $\vec{V}_{K,c'}$ (what's being looked for), and a *scalar* per head, $(\vec{U}^h_{Q,c})^\top \vec{U}^h_{K,c'}$, saying how strongly this looker operates through head $h$. The $V$ vectors are shared across heads; only the scalar differs. **One QK computation, distributed over heads with different gains** — head superposition, made concrete.

### Exercise - per-head norms of attention subcomponents

> You should spend up to 10-15 minutes on this exercise.

Implement `per_head_norms`: split a $U$ matrix's write vectors into the 6 per-head segments ($d_{head}=128$ each) and compute each segment's norm. The cell below it is given: it computes reference causal importances (`ci_ref`, reused for the rest of this section) and an `alive_indices` helper, then plots the (alive subcomponents × heads) norm matrix for layer 1's $W_Q$ and $W_K$, normalised per subcomponent. You should reproduce the paper's figure: essentially **no subcomponent is localised to a single head** (in our run, no subcomponent put more than ~0.9 of its norm in one head, and the mean max-share was ~0.2 — i.e. spread).

## Static Interaction Strength

The per-head-scalar equation above ignores one thing our model has: RoPE. Queries and keys get rotated by position before the dot product, so the interaction between a Q subcomponent and a K subcomponent depends on the **offset** $\tau$ (query position minus key position):

$$W_{QK,\tau}^h = (W_Q^h)^\top \boldsymbol{R}_\tau W_K^h$$

<details>
<summary>Refresher - RoPE in two paragraphs</summary>

Rotary position embeddings inject position into attention by **rotating queries and keys before their dot product**: the query at position $t$ becomes $\boldsymbol{R}_t q_t$ and the key at position $t'$ becomes $\boldsymbol{R}_{t'} k_{t'}$, where $\boldsymbol{R}_p$ rotates the $d_{head}$-dimensional vector two coordinates at a time — each 2D pair of dimensions spins by angle $p \cdot \theta_d$, with its own frequency $\theta_d$ from a geometric schedule (fast-spinning pairs resolve nearby positions, slow ones long range).

The payoff: rotations compose, so the two position rotations collapse into a single rotation by the *difference* of positions, and the score becomes $q_t^\top \boldsymbol{R}_{t-t'}\, k_{t'}$ (in this section's convention, $\tau = t - t'$ = query position minus key position). Attention scores depend on the **relative offset only**, never on absolute position — and that's also what makes SIS possible: "what does this pair of subcomponents do at offset $\tau$" is a well-posed question about the weights alone, answered by sandwiching one rotation matrix $\boldsymbol{R}_\tau$ between the per-head write vectors. The treacherous part is purely bookkeeping — *which dimensions pair up* (this model: the split-half convention, dimension $d$ with $d + d_{head}/2$) and the sign of the angle — which is why the exercise makes you pass a numerical check before your $\boldsymbol{R}_\tau$ is used for anything.

</details>

This is a feature, not a bug: it means a single pair of subcomponents can implement *position-dependent* behaviour, like "attend to keys 1-3 tokens back". The paper packages the pair-strength-at-offset into the **Static Interaction Strength**:

$$\text{SIS}(c, c', \tau, h) = \Big(s_{Q,c}\, \|\vec{V}_{Q,c}\|\, \vec{U}^h_{Q,c}\Big)^\top \boldsymbol{R}_{\tau} \Big(s_{K,c'}\, \|\vec{V}_{K,c'}\|\, \vec{U}^h_{K,c'}\Big)$$

Three pieces of bookkeeping, each there for a reason you should be able to articulate (drop-down below to check): the $\|\vec{V}\|$ factors, the data-dependent signs $s = \text{sign}(\mathbb{E}[\varphi \vec{V}])$ (the average inner activation where the subcomponent is causally important), and per-head standardisation (subtract head mean, divide by head std over all $(c, c', \tau)$) before comparing across heads.

<details>
<summary>Why each correction?</summary>

* **$\|\vec{V}\|$ scaling**: $U$ and $V$ are only defined up to a swapped scalar ($\beta U, V/\beta$ is the same subcomponent), so $U$-$U$ dot products between *different* subcomponents are meaningless until you fix the gauge. Multiplying each $U$ by its partner $V$'s norm makes the product equal to the full subcomponent's contribution.
* **Signs**: the gauge also has a sign ambiguity ($-U, -V$ is the same subcomponent), and what we care about is the sign of the contribution *when the subcomponent actually fires*. If the typical inner activation is negative, flipping by its sign converts "geometry" into "effect on attention score in practice": positive SIS = this pair raises attention when both fire.
* **Standardising per head**: each head has its own softmax, which is invariant to shifting all of that head's scores by a constant — so raw interaction values only mean something *relative to that head's other interactions*, and comparing raw magnitudes across heads is meaningless. Z-scoring within a head is a normalisation heuristic that makes "strong, for this head" the common unit. (Note softmax is *not* scale-invariant — scale acts like temperature — so this is a pragmatic normalisation, not an exact symmetry argument.)

### Exercise - implement `static_interaction_strength`

> You should spend up to 35-45 minutes on this exercise. It's the centrepiece of this section.

Implement SIS for layer 1, for all pairs of alive Q and K subcomponents, offsets $\tau \in [0, 49]$, all 6 heads. Steps:

1. Build $\boldsymbol{R}_\tau$ from the model's own rotary `sin`/`cos` buffers (split-half convention: dimension $d$ pairs with $d + d_{head}/2$). We've given you a numerical test that checks your $R_\tau$ against the model's actual attention computation — *make sure it passes before continuing*, RoPE conventions are the classic source of silent wrongness.
2. Compute the signs from causal importances over a few hundred dataset sequences.
3. Assemble SIS and standardise per head.

Then make the paper's plot: for each head, the SIS-vs-offset curves of the top-10 pairs (by max |SIS| anywhere). You're looking for the pair **`q:316` × `k:329`**: strongly positive at offsets 1-2 and decaying or negative beyond — the *previous-token looker* — with the same shape visible in several heads at different gains.

<details>
<summary>Help - how do I build R_tau, and what shapes should I be einsum-ing?</summary>

**$R_\tau$**: with the split-half convention, dimension $d$ pairs with $d + d_{head}/2$, and pair $d$ rotates by angle $\tau \cdot \theta_d$ where $\theta_d$ comes from the model's frequency schedule. The cleanest construction: take the model's `rotary_cos`/`rotary_sin` buffers at position $\tau$ (they're indexed by position, and rotation by position $p$ then $-p'$ composes to $p - p' = \tau$), and build the $d_{head} \times d_{head}$ matrix in 2×2 blocks spread across the two halves:

$$R_\tau[d, d] = \cos_\tau[d], \quad R_\tau[d, d{+}h] = -\sin_\tau[d], \quad R_\tau[d{+}h, d] = \sin_\tau[d], \quad R_\tau[d{+}h, d{+}h] = \cos_\tau[d]$$

for $d < h := d_{head}/2$ (equivalently `lm_utils.build_rope_rotation_matrix`). **Run the provided numerical check first** — it compares $q_t^\top R_{t-t'} k_{t'}$ against the model's own pre-softmax scores. If yours is transposed/sign-flipped you'll see it instantly here, instead of three exercises later in a wrong SIS plot.

**Shapes**: reshape each $U_Q \in \mathbb{R}^{C_Q \times d_{model}}$ to `(C_q, n_heads, d_head)` (the per-head segments), pre-scale by $\|\vec{V}_Q\|$ and the sign, stack the rotations to `(n_tau, d_head, d_head)`, then one einsum gives the whole thing:

```python
sis = einops.einsum(
    Uq_scaled, R_taus, Uk_scaled,
    "c_q head d1, tau d1 d2, c_k head d2 -> c_q c_k tau head",
)
```

Standardise with `sis.mean(dim=(0,1,2))` / `.std(dim=(0,1,2))` per head. For ~15 alive Q × ~48 alive K subcomponents × 50 offsets × 6 heads this is instant; don't compute it over all 512 × 512 dead pairs.

<summary>What you should see</summary>

The curves plot should qualitatively match the paper figure above: in each head, a handful of pairs with structured offset profiles, the rest hugging zero. In the printed `q:316` × `k:329` rows, look for clearly positive z-scores at offsets 1-2 in several heads at once, decaying toward zero or negative at larger offsets — and *not* a large value at offset 0, which is what makes this a previous-token looker rather than a same-token one. (The per-head sizes of those peaks foreshadow the ablation table in the next exercise.)

Two classic failure signatures: if your top pairs come out strongly *negative* at offsets 1-2 (everything mirror-imaged), your sign convention is flipped — re-read the `subcomponent_signs` spec; if the curves look plausible but shifted or scrambled along $\tau$, that's an $R_\tau$ convention bug the numerical pre-check should have caught — go back and make sure it actually ran green.

## Dynamic analysis, and ablating one interaction

SIS is data-independent (it only looks at weights, plus a sign statistic). To see an interaction *acting* on a prompt, use the **Data-Dependent Interaction Strength**: pair $(c, c')$'s contribution to the attention score between positions $t, t'$:

$$\text{DDIS}(c, c', t, t', h) = \big(\varphi \vec{V}_{Q,c}\big)_t \left( (\vec{U}^h_{Q,c})^\top \boldsymbol{R}_{t-t'} \vec{U}^h_{K,c'} \right) \big(\varphi \vec{V}_{K,c'}\big)_{t'}$$

Summed over all pairs, DDIS *is* the attention score (check this — it's a two-line proof from the key equation, and your implementation should verify it numerically; remember the model applies a $1/\sqrt{d_{head}}$ factor before the softmax, so decide which side of your assertion carries it, and note that the sum needs *all* subcomponents plus the $\Delta$-components of $W_Q$ and $W_K$, not just the alive ones — check how big the delta correction actually is). Which means we can do surgery: **subtract one pair's DDIS from the scores and re-softmax** to see the attention pattern "without" that interaction.

### Exercise - ablate the previous-token interaction

On a Pile prompt: (1) verify your DDIS sums to the true attention scores; (2) remove the `q:316`×`k:329` pair's contribution and plot each head's average attention-to-previous-token before vs after. The paper's claim to replicate: this *single pair* of rank-1 objects carries previous-token attention **in every head that has it** — a computation no head-level analysis could have isolated, because it isn't *in* any head.

<figcaption>Head 1 is "the" previous-token head by the classic average-attention measure — but several heads place real weight at offset 1, and your ablation will show one subcomponent pair carries it everywhere. Figure from <a href="https://www.goodfire.ai/research/interpreting-lm-parameters">Bushnaq et al. (2026)</a>, loaded from the original Goodfire post.</figcaption>
</figure>

Afterwards, explore: the syntax-boundary pair (`q:316`×`k:119`, strongest at *larger* offsets — same query, different key, different range!), and the copula detector (`q:308`×`k:218` "it", `q:308`×`k:485` "there/it") from the paper's third case study — feed it "It is raining" vs "She is a doctor" and watch the DDIS light up only for the former, which is the mechanistic explanation of the contextual CI you found earlier.

<details>
<summary>Reference values from our test run</summary>

On a 64-token Pile prompt: the delta components carry only ~7% of the attention scores (so the subcomponent pairs really do account for the QK circuit), and removing the single `q:316`×`k:329` pair changes mean attention-to-previous-token per head as:

```
head 0: 0.243 -> 0.044      head 3: 0.300 -> 0.048
head 1: 0.641 -> 0.014      head 4: 0.072 -> 0.052
head 2: 0.168 -> 0.042      head 5: 0.171 -> 0.041
```

Head 1 is the model's "previous token head" by the classic head-level analysis — but notice the same pair is carrying the previous-token attention of heads 0, 2, 3 and 5 too. One rank-1 interaction, six heads. That asymmetric-but-everywhere profile is what "distributed across heads" means concretely, and it's invisible to any analysis that treats heads as the unit.

## Capstone: editing the model's algorithm by hand

To close, the paper's proof-of-concept that parameter decomposition buys *engineering control*, not just understanding. The task: make the model believe all emoticons are surprised faces — after `:`, `;`, `=`, `X` etc. in an emoticon context, predict `o` — **without retraining and without damaging anything else**.

Why this is hard with normal tools: you can't just remap tokens (a `:` in normal prose must keep behaving normally), and finetuning/LoRA needs a labelled dataset and gives you an uninterpretable diff. The decomposition gives a third way: the model has subcomponents in layer 2's MLP-down matrix that fire **specifically on the first character of emoticons** (the paper lists six; we'll use `2.mlp.down:2359`). A rank-1 subcomponent has one read direction and one write direction — so if we keep its read direction (the "emoticon detector" trigger) and *replace its write direction* with the unembedding direction of `o`, the trigger now fires a vote for `o`.

<details>
<summary>Refresher - what "the unembedding direction of `o`" is</summary>

The model's last step is a linear map from the final residual stream to logits: `lm_head.weight` has one row per vocab token, and token `o`'s logit is the dot product of the final residual with row `o_id`. That row is the **unembedding direction** $\vec{u}_o$ — the direction in residual space that, when present, votes for `o` as the next token. Anything any layer writes along $+\vec{u}_o$ raises `o`'s logit (the final RMSNorm rescales the residual but mostly preserves its direction). So replacing a write vector with a multiple of $\vec{u}_o / \|\vec{u}_o\|$ is the most literal possible "predict `o` here" instruction. If you did the induction-heads day (1.2, optional): this is direct logit attribution run in reverse — instead of measuring which writes align with the unembedding, we install one.

</details>

The edit, in your section-2 vocabulary, with $\vec{u}_o$ the unembedding column of `o`:

$$\vec{U}_{2359} \leftarrow -\alpha\, \vec{u}_o / \|\vec{u}_o\| \qquad \Big(\text{equivalently } W' = W - \big(\vec{U}_{2359} + \alpha \tfrac{\vec{u}_o}{\|\vec{u}_o\|}\big) \vec{V}_{2359}^\top \Big)$$

(Why the minus sign? The subcomponent's inner activation is *negative* at its firing positions — check this with the same sign statistic you used for SIS, recomputed for this subcomponent. Two gotchas in that check: its input is the layer-2 MLP's post-GELU hidden activations, not the residual stream; and you must compute it on **emoticon-containing prompts** — ordinary Pile batches contain essentially no emoticons, so `2.mlp.down:2359` never fires there and the statistic over an empty set is meaningless (a naive implementation silently falls back to +1, flipping your edit's sign!). On the `EMOTICON_PROMPTS` below, the firing-position activation is ≈ −1.9. Writing $-\vec{u}_o$ times a negative activation adds a *positive* multiple of the `o` direction to the residual stream.)

### Exercise - perform and evaluate the emoticon edit

> ```yaml
> Difficulty: 🔴🔴🔴⚪⚪
> Importance: 🔵🔵🔵🔵⚪
> 
> You should spend up to 30-40 minutes on this exercise.
> ```

1. Implement `edit_subcomponent(model, layer_matrix, c, new_U)` operating directly on the target model's weights via the formula above (note: the edited model is a plain model again — no decomposition machinery at inference; the edit is just a weight delta).
2. Evaluate with $\alpha = 3$ on prompts containing emoticons: report mean $P(\text{`o'})$ at emoticon positions, before and after. Concretely: each `EMOTICON_PROMPTS` entry ends right at an emoticon's first character, so "at emoticon positions" means the softmax probability of the `o` token at the final position of each prompt, averaged over prompts.
3. Off-target check: mean per-token KL(target ‖ edited) on (a) the 20 tokens around each emoticon, (b) ordinary Pile text. Sweep $\alpha \in \{1, 2, 3, 5, 8\}$ and plot the on-target-vs-off-target Pareto curve. For calibration, the paper's version of this trade-off (manual edit vs trained LoRA baselines):

</figure>
4. The fun part: generate text from the edited model containing `:` and `;` in both emoticon and non-emoticon contexts. `:)` should be gone; colons in prose should be untouched.

<details>
<summary>Refresher - which way round KL goes</summary>

$D_{\mathrm{KL}}(P \,\|\, Q) = \sum_x P(x) \log\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}$ — an expectation under the **first** argument, and asymmetric. KL(target ‖ edited) puts the original model in the first slot: it weights every token by how much probability the *target* assigned, so it punishes the edit for destroying probability mass the model used to place, and barely notices mass the edit invents where the target had none. That's the right direction for "did we damage existing behaviour". Per-token here means: sum over the vocab dimension at each position, then average over all positions.

Torch flips the reading order: `F.kl_div(input, target)` computes KL(target ‖ input), where `input` is the **log**-probs of the second slot (the edited model) and `target` is the plain probs of the first. Mixing up which side gets the log fails silently — negative or absurdly large KLs are the symptom to watch for.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Reference values from our test run</summary>

| $\alpha$ | mean P(`o`) on emoticon prompts | off-target KL (ordinary text) |
|---:|---:|---:|
| none | 0.016 | 0 |
| 1 | 0.48 | 0.0007 |
| 2 | 0.68 | 0.0028 |
| 3 | 0.75 | 0.0061 |
| 5 | 0.95 | 0.0175 |
| 8 | 0.997 | 0.0623 |

And the generations at $\alpha=3$: `"Thanks so much! :"` completes to `:o` — while `"The ratio was 3:"` still completes to `3:1` and `"Dear Sam: I"` continues as ordinary prose. The trigger is the *mechanism* (the emoticon-context read direction), not the token.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Discussion - what did we just learn, and what didn't we?</summary>

The paper's honest framing: a LoRA trained on ~1000 curated examples beats this edit on off-target metrics, and the example is openly cherry-picked — emoticon prediction was chosen *because* the model had unusually clean dedicated subcomponents for it. The point isn't that rank-1 edits are the best editing tool today — it's that they're *zero-shot* (no dataset; you read the algorithm and rewrote it) and *interpretable* (the diff is one rank-1 matrix you can state in English). It's also a genuine causal validation of the decomposition: if `2.mlp.down:2359` weren't really "the emoticon mechanism", overwriting its write-direction wouldn't produce this clean behavioural change. Editing is the strongest form of "we found the mechanism" evidence there is.
